      <description>Here comes part III of the Hamler blog post series &amp;hellip;
One of the observations was that for/on Day21 hamler ~6000 times slower than haskell, where in general we where able to see that it was 5-20 times slower.
Just looked into this a little bit and there is good news and bad news. The good news is I found something.
I can make the hamer solution run 10 times faster by changing the implementation of part1 from &amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Here comes part II of the Hamler blog post series &amp;hellip;
For this year&amp;rsquo;s Advent-of-Code I wanted to take a look at Hamler.
I just finished implementing all of the part-1 solutions in Hamler.
I had to skip Day 20 (the seamonster), because Hamler only supports a very small/limited number of packages, which means I would have needed to write a lot of code before I would have been able to tackle the actual problem.</description>

      <description>Hamler Blog Post Series &amp;hellip;
 Hamler (I) - First week (this post) Hamler (II) - All solutions for part 1 (in Hamler and Haskell) Hamler (III) - Making Day21 10 times faster   What&amp;rsquo;s at the intersection of Haskell, the Erlang Beam/OTP and the Advent-of-Code?
Yes, right: Hamler!
Hamler is a Haskell-like language that runs on the Erlang Beam/OTP.
At Community we are big Beam/OTP fans (because we like highly-scalable and highly-available shared nothing micro-services systems).</description>

      <description>Today Advent of Code 2018 started again (at 05:00am (GMT))!!!
And &amp;hellip;
&amp;hellip; just in time &amp;hellip;
&amp;hellip; today I am also wrapping up Advent of Code 2017!!!
My first implementation was (obviously) in Scala.
And that one alone was interesting, because I also used ScalaCheck for property-based testing and ScalaMeter to implement performance tests for all solutions.
I then made the Scala code cross-compile with ScalaNative.
At the time I was also learning Kotlin and spend some cycles to port the code to Kotlin.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the Advent of Code &amp;hellip; again!!!
Last time we talked about a/the Scala implementation.
This time around I figured that I need to understand what the hype about Kotlin is all about and decided to port my Scala solutions to Kotlin.
There is a separate blog post on what I think about Kotlin, but overall it was a positive experience. I like Kotlin (but would not suggest/recommend it as a replacement for Scala).</description>

      <description>OK &amp;hellip; it took me a while, but &amp;hellip; hopefully it was worth it!!!
Last year at christmas I did the Advent of Code and &amp;hellip; really liked it!!!
If you do not know it, it is a series (25 of them) of code puzzles that need to be solved to unlock a/the christmas tree (every day (between Dec. 1st and Dec. 25th) a new/the next puzzle becomes available).
The puzzles do a lot of different things and will test your ability to come up with good/clever datastructures/algorithms.</description>
