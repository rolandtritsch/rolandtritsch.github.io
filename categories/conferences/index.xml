      <description>Sometimes it takes a while to get to it &amp;hellip;
 Last year I was opening Data-by-the-Bay and was welcoming/addressing the attendees. Wanted to turn it into a blog post and never got around to do it. Finally &amp;hellip; here we go &amp;hellip;

Good morning everybody. On behalf of Nitro: Welcome to Data by the Bay.
My name is Roland Tritsch and I am German and I am the VP Engineering at Nitro.</description>

      <description>I am just back from the Deep Learning (DL) Summit in London, where I had very interesting 2 days with a lot of good presentations and a lot of time to think about the future.
I am working with Nitro for a year now and have learned a lot about Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), but as always: the more you learn, the more you understand that you know nothing.</description>
