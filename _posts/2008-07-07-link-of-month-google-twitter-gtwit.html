Micro-blogging (Twitter, Pounce, Facebook, ...) just go a little bit easier. Check out GTwit. It is a light-weight Google App, that allows you to access your Twitter account from any browser you might have access to. It is based on the Twitter API.  It stores all tweets that you send/receive in a private "Google-Cloud" and allows you to search on them by whatever you like (word, person, tag).<br /><br />Check it out.
