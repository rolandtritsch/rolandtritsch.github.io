title: To become or not to become ... a Sunday with Scala and Actors
---

<br />It is Sunday, the sun is shining ... in Ireland!!! What do you do? Right: You get your laptop and finally start to get your head around the actor model in Scala.<br /><br />In my case I tried to come up with a <a href="https://github.com/rolandtritsch/scala-dining-philosophers" target="_blank">simulation</a> for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem" target="_blank">Dining Philosophers Problem</a> (DPP). There are <a href="https://github.com/akka/akka/blob/master/akka-samples/akka-sample-fsm/src/main/scala/DiningHakkersOnBecome.scala" target="_blank">implementations</a> available, but I consolidated them and renamed the states and transitions to make it more obvious what is going on and used <a href="http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">plantUML</a> to come up with State Transition Diagrams (STDs) that show what is going on.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-d2ckmSiOAhA/UlQhNWghElI/AAAAAAAAAIc/D_mfNKQy80M/s1600/Philosopher.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="311" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-d2ckmSiOAhA/UlQhNWghElI/AAAAAAAAAIc/D_mfNKQy80M/s400/Philosopher.png" width="400" /></a></div><br />The model detects potential deadlocks and asks the philosopher to put down all forks, before trying again.<br /><div><br /></div>The epiphany of the day was that you need to use become() to model the states :).
