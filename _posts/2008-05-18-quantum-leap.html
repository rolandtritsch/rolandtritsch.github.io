Today we went to a <a href="http://www.goireland.com/dublin/merrion-square-outdoor-art-sale-and-exhibition-attraction-exhibitions-id43220.htm">local art (flee) market</a>. We were looking for some paintings for our new house.  At the end we could not agree on anything, but I was in the right mindset to find something that will focus the mind, when I am at my desk.<div><br /></div><div>I like innovation and I like to innovate. Sometimes this requires to take a leap of faith to produce a quantum leap. Just bought <a href="http://www.annanielsen.com/catalogue/prints/limitededition/shortstories/quantumleap.htm">Quantum Leap from Anne Nielsen</a>. </div>
