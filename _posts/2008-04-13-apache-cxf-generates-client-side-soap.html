Yep. It was inevitable. Sooner or later we need to talk about the iPhone.<div><br /></div><div>And there is a lot to talk about ...</div><div><br /></div><div><ul><li>the innovative hardware</li><li>the business model behind it</li><li>the market this device might be able to create</li><li>and a lot of other disruptive changes that come with it</li></ul><div>But today I just want to talk about a neat feature that I discovered in <a href="http://cwiki.apache.org/CXF/">Apache-CXF</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>In January I was looking for ways to <marketing>make the mobile device a first-class citizen in a distributed SOA</marketing>. Right now, there are probably three platforms types that you can consider when it comes to mobile devices and the integration of mobile devices with (SOA) backend systems:</div><div><ul><li>Native - means you are using a platform SDK (e.g. .Net, Symbian, iPhone SDK) and write applications directly for a given platform.<br /></li><li>JAVA - means you are using the JAVA ME platform. Potentially/Hopefully in combination with an OSGi container.</li><li>Browser - means you are using a browser and implement your application as (AJAX-based) WebApplications (XHTML, CSS, JavaScript (with XmlHttpRequest objects).</li></ul><div>Right now, you can develop applications for the iPhone using option 1 and 3. Option 2 is not an option, because there is <a href="http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t88464.html">no JVM</a> for the iPhone (but <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/03/07/sun-iphone-java_1.html">SUN</a> recently announce that this will change later in the year :)).</div><div><br /></div><div>Option 3 got a lot of merits, but leaves you with the daunting task to write all of the JavaScript marshaling code yourself :(.</div><div><br /></div><div>And here is where the miracle happens: The next version of Apache-CXF (2.1) has a feature that allows you to <a href="http://cwiki.apache.org/CXF20DOC/javascript-clients.html">generate JavaScript client-side code for WebServices</a>. Either from an WSDL file or from annotated JAVA source code or dynamically at runtime.</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">It makes writing WebApplications for the iPhone so much easier.</span></div><div><br /></div><div>I have ported some of the CXF demos to the iPhone. The podcast, the presentation and the source code is available on <a href="http://open.iona.com/wiki/display/ProdInfo/FUSE+Master+Class+Series">open.iona.com</a> and on <a href="http://www.tritsch.org/Podcast/044D9C8C-29A6-4C38-96F8-933A3F9E3335.html">www.tritsch.org</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>Check it out. Feedback welcome.</div></div></div>
