      <description>Ok &amp;hellip; it is not a secret: I have been to the Isle of Man (IOM) once or twice (for the the TT and the Manx Grand-Prix).&#xA;And every 12 month I find myself in the same situation &amp;hellip;&#xA;I get myself a (free) pay-as-you-go ManxTM SIM card I get myself a 10 pound voucher and top-up the card with it (this gives me 10GB of data, which is plenty for 2 weeks) I cannot get the data connection to work The THING to remember (and the secret to success) is that you ALSO have to (manually) adjust your internet settings on your (Android) phone.</description>

      <description>Updated (2021-08-14): Added some test data (at the end; see below)&#xA;As I said before &amp;hellip;&#xA;When you work from anywhere (or even from home) it is YOUR(!!!) responsibility to ensure that you are connected!!!&#xA;Statements like &amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Sorry &amp;hellip; I cannot join the standup, because I was not able to find a WLAN hotspot.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Can you hear me? Sorry &amp;hellip; I am on a shitty/weak WLAN.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Sorry &amp;hellip; can we switch off the video.</description>

      <description>I am in Hidden Valley Holiday Park. Working on the career progression framework for Community. It is 5am and &amp;hellip; I realized something. Don&amp;rsquo;t hold your breath: It is something obvious (but I thought I share it anyway).&#xA;If you want to be successful as an Extreme Digital Nomad, having a good internet connection is absolutely essential (this is more true now then ever before, because of Covid-19 an even bigger part of the job relies on videoconverencing).</description>

      <title>Discussing Remote ... the book!!!</title>
      <link>http://tedn.life/2020/04/07/discussing-remote-...-the-book/</link>

      <guid>http://tedn.life/2020/04/07/discussing-remote-...-the-book/</guid>
      <description>These days people look for advice and insight into how to build and run a remote-first engineering organization. And want/need to learn fast!!!&#xA;One good resource is (obviously) Remote (kind of the bible on working remote).&#xA;The book was published in 2013 (and was probably written in the 12 month before that).&#xA;Obviously the key messages/statements from the book are still true (or truer than ever), but I think that since then things have also changed and evolved.</description>

      <title>TEDN - The most important tool ...</title>
      <link>http://tedn.life/2020/04/06/tedn-the-most-important-tool-.../</link>

      <description>&amp;hellip; is the laptop? No (but more on this later)!&#xA;&amp;hellip; is the mobile phone (with good 4G coverage)? No (and again &amp;hellip; more on this later)!&#xA;&amp;hellip; is a foldable coffee mug!!!&#xA;When you start to work remote (from home, from any place, &amp;hellip;) you will discover that you will end up in coffee shops (either because you want to (because you want/need to fight the cabin fever) or because you have to (because you want/need to find/have a WLAN connection)).</description>

      <title>The Extreme Digital Nomad (TEDN)</title>
      <link>http://tedn.life/2020/03/31/the-extreme-digital-nomad-tedn/</link>

      <description>In the last 25 years I have build and run multiple distributed software engineering organisations.&#xA;My management style/philosophy is based on a couple of core believes &amp;hellip;&#xA;The Power of Why - I like to lead with Why (to make sure Talent and Passion can meet a Purpose) People first - I always think and feel that people are the solution (not the problem) Heterogenerity for the win - You have to be different to complement each other (and to create innovation) No surprises - Everybody (at all times) should be clear on what is happening and why it is happening, which leads to &amp;hellip; Building and maintain trust (and respect) (between the people) at all cost!</description>

      <description>A long weekend in San Francisco (Jul., 4th - Independence Day), great weather and nothing to do?&#xA;I smell opportunity! Opportunity to do something that I always wanted to do: Explore the bay area on a motor bike.&#xA;The Nitro CEO was kind enough to introduce me to Wolfgang and Wolfgang and his team helped me to get my hands on a BMW R1200 RT and off we go.&#xA;Motorcycling in San Francisco (SF) can be tricky.</description>
