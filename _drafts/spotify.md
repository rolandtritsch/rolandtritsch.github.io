title: To Spotify or not to Spotify ... that is the question here
---
Finding a good and maybe even the right org structure for an engineering organization is something of a dark art.

Initially everything is so easy. 5-10 engineers are in one location, have one boss, work on the one thing and have one common skill.

But then your are successful. And you hire more engineers and then you realize that to derisk the hiring and the growth you probably want to hire in more than one location and then a couple of engineers will leave, because the people management aspect of the [being an engineering manager](http://www.slideshare.net/mikebrittain/from-building-a-marketplace-to-building-teams) is not something that comes natural to most of us. Oh dear ... and then things get ... **interesting** :)

And then Spotify invented the squads and the tribes and the guilds and the chapters ... and everything looked so easy. Except ... it is not.

First of all, the biggest challenge is still not to talk about it, but to do it. Every day. You have to life it. And that is true regardless of the model that you pick or choose to implement.

Second, the Spotify model works for Spotify. There is no gurantee it will work for you. But it is a good start. And nothing prevents you to just pick the pieces that work for you and/or customise the model so that it works for you.

Nitro is not different from a lot of other startups. After a phase of rapid growth we ended up with to many engineering locations (4) and not enough crictical mass in each of them and no coheerent org strcuture model to keep it all together.

Right now we are in the process to consolidate all our engineering into two (2) locations (Dublin and San Francisco). We also looked at the org structure and reflected what we want and need to get done in 2017. We need to ...

* ... put a stronger focus on people managment
* ... maintain our focus on strong technical leadership
* ... increase our velocity (ship more and ship more often)
* ... hire and onboard a lot of engineers (2-3 per month)
* ... make it work for two locations

* Squads have a purpose and a limited live time (and a location)
* Guilds master a craft and are more long-term (and do the people managemnt)

* Lets do Spotify-light
* Eat the cake and have it too
* Do not give up on the essentials (e.g. autonomy)
