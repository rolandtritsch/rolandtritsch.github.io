title:  "New Job, New Site, ..."
---

Yep ... I got a new job and yep ... I got a new website.

In reverse order, first: (Given that I am a VP Infrastructure Engineering) I am currently in the process to refactor my personal infrastructure and I am consolidate most of it on GitHub and Amazon. The result is the wonderful new website you are looking at. The pages are on GitHub ([pages](https://pages.github.com) based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)) and the domains and the DNS are hosted on Amazon.

And second: I got a new Job. Last week I started with [Nitro](https://www.gonitro.com/about) as VP Infrastructure Engineering and I am going to build a cloud-based infrastructure platform for their next-generation Smart Document Platform.
