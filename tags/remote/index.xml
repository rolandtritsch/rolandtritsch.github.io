      <description>These days people look for advice and insight into how to build and run a remote-first engineering organization. And want/need to learn fast!!!
One good resource is (obviously) Remote (kind of the bible on working remote).
The book was published in 2013 (and was probably written in the 12 month before that).
Obviously the key messages/statements from the book are still true (or truer than ever), but I think that since then things have also changed and evolved.</description>

      <description>Fig 1: Skating to where the puck ...  Finding good and the right talent for an engineering organisation is as challenging as ever.
And then you need to keep engagement high and attrition low and you need to build/deliver something (with good/high velocity/efficiency/quality).
One key component to get this right is a good/the right structure for your engineering organisation.
And you probably want to structure it in a way so that it not only works today, but also in 2-3 years from now, because otherwise by the time you are done building the org it will not work (anymore)).</description>
