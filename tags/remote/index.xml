      <description>Updated (2021-08-14): Added some test data (at the end; see below)
As I said before &amp;hellip;
 When you work from anywhere (or even from home) it is YOUR(!!!) responsibility to ensure that you are connected!!!
Statements like &amp;hellip;
 &amp;ldquo;Sorry &amp;hellip; I cannot join the standup, because I was not able to find a WLAN hotspot.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Can you hear me? Sorry &amp;hellip; I am on a shitty/weak WLAN.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Sorry &amp;hellip; can we switch off the video.</description>

      <description>Two weeks ago I got my second jab. I am fully vaccinated now. I am now in Germany to see my parents for the first time in 12 month.
Yes: It is finally happening! The pandemic (slowly, but surely) comes to an end.
Which creates (for some of us and for some companies) a big question: What&amp;rsquo;s the next step? What&amp;rsquo;s the path forward (e.g. from a organisational structure/development point of view)?</description>

      <title>Distances - Know them. Manage them.</title>

      <description>Building and managing remote-first organizations means that you also need to understand (and manage) distances!
To develop your ability to understand and manage distances is very important because human beings naturally need closeness (to other people and/or the purpose of the endeavor) to feel a sense of belonging.
But &amp;hellip; wait a sec: What do you mean by distances (plural)? Is there more than one?
Big surprise: Yes! When I build and run remote-first organizations I worry about and manage at least the following distances &amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>As people know &amp;hellip; I am big fan of building and maintain this balance between Product and Engineering where &amp;hellip;
Product makes sure we build the right thing and Engineering makes sure we built it right (and we help each other to do so :)) But that is only the start. The real magic happens when we get to a point where we are not building faster horses. If the conversation goes wrong it goes like this &amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>Discussing Remote ... the book!!!</title>
      <link>http://tedn.life/2020/04/07/discussing-remote-...-the-book/</link>

      <description>These days people look for advice and insight into how to build and run a remote-first engineering organization. And want/need to learn fast!!!
One good resource is (obviously) Remote (kind of the bible on working remote).
The book was published in 2013 (and was probably written in the 12 month before that).
Obviously the key messages/statements from the book are still true (or truer than ever), but I think that since then things have also changed and evolved.</description>

      <title>Hub-First vs. Remote-First vs. Pod-First ... Skating to where the puck is going to be</title>

      <description>Fig 1: Skating to where the puck ...  Finding good and the right talent for an engineering organisation is as challenging as ever.
And then you need to keep engagement high and attrition low and you need to build/deliver something (with good/high velocity/efficiency/quality).
One key component to get this right is a good/the right structure for your engineering organisation.
And you probably want to structure it in a way so that it not only works today, but also in 2-3 years from now, because otherwise by the time you are done building the org it will not work (anymore)).</description>
