      <description>Right now I am solving the 99-scala-problems. Again!!!&#xA;This time around I am using them to learn more about what it means to be an Augmented Software Engineer (ASE). Just subscribe to the podcast to follow along.&#xA;P50 is to build a Huffman tree and to return the set of Huffman codes for the given string.&#xA;codeium found a good implementation, but struggled to find tests that worked.&#xA;I then tried various websites ([1], [2], [3], [4]) to test various strings and noticed that the trees and the resulting set of codes are different between the implementations.</description>

      <description>Updated &amp;hellip;&#xA;2024-11-08: Added section at the end on published and planned episodes&#xA;I can hear you loud and clear &amp;hellip;&#xA;Ooohhh my god: Not another blog post about AI!!!&#xA;Bear with me. I will try to make reading it (or watching it) worth while your time. I promise.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s set the stage. My opinion is &amp;hellip;&#xA;The planet has problems (over-population, climate-change, poverty and economic inequality, cancer and alzheimer, &amp;hellip;).</description>

      <description>This is a landmark blog post. I just introduced a tag called Augmented-by-AI. And this post is tagged with it.&#xA;This is going to be the new normal. Let me explain &amp;hellip;&#xA;First things first: This blog post is not written by chatGPT.&#xA;It is Sunday morning, 6am and I am sitting here in my living room in my PJ with a cup of coffee and I am typing this. Believe me &amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>This blog post is interesting in more than one way, because &amp;hellip;&#xA;I am going to discuss a topic that is deer to my heart: What do we need to do to get to a better place with respect to a sustainable energy future? And I am going to use a new approach: Where I am first going to articulate my thoughts and then I am going to complement it with a fireside chat that I had with chatGPT about the topics at hand.</description>
