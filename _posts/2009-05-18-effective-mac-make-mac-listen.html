title: Effective Mac - Make the Mac listen ...
---

This morning I was using my new <a href="http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2007/biz2/0709/gallery.favorites_tools.biz2/index.html">JawBone</a> Bluetooth headset to make a Skype call. The quality was bad and therefore I decided to switch to my headset. The result was better, but still not what I was looking for. At the end I took the time to really understand, where the sound is coming from and to my big surprise I found out that the <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=342539">line-in jack is not working with normal headsets</a>.<div><br /></div><div>On the Mac you need a mic (or a headset) with "power" (e.g. a USB mic or a pre-amp mic). </div><div><br /></div><div>Conclusion: I have stored away my headset and will use the built-in speaker/built-in mic to make calls. In case I need privacy I will just plug in my iPhone earbuds. That sounds like a/the winning configuration. But that also means that I do not have a solution for environments with a lot of background noise. Maybe I need to go back and need to find out why the quality with the JawBone was bad in the first place.</div>
