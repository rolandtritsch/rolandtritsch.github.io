... to FUSEsource.com. As part of the Progress acquisition we decided to change the host/domain name of the FUSE community website from open.iona.com to FUSEsource.com.<div><br /></div><div>I like the new name better, because what we do here is not about a company (be it IONA or Progress). It is about a project. In our case FUSE.</div><div><br /></div><div>The renaming will also allow us to role out more interesting stuff in the near future on a new, consistent family of good host/domain names. Stay tuned :).Â </div>
