      <description>Ok &amp;hellip; I admit it! I am using emacs! A lot!&#xA;I am also using emacs to do my tooting.&#xA;Means I am using mastodon.el.&#xA;The other day I had to reset/reinstall my emacs configuration and had to re-authenticate my mastodon server.&#xA;That proofed to be more challenging than I thought, because there is a screen missing. Let me explain &amp;hellip; or even better: Let me walk you through how you can reset the authentication, if/when you have to &amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>We (at Community) just had another Innovation-Week. I was actually working on generating pact-files from frontend code and then generating openapi spec files from elxir backend code and then automatically check that the frontend pact is compatible with the backend openapi spec while running the build pipeline for the frontend(s)/backend.&#xA;But this is not what this blog post is all about :).&#xA;While working on this Geoff and myself also decided that it is a good opportunity to sharpen the tools and take remote-first pair-programming to the next level.</description>

      <description>At community (as everywhere these days) we are not using one programming language, we are using a set of programming languages, means for one week I find myself writing a lot of elixir, the next week I write go, the week afterwards I need to fix some of our terraform configurations and on the weekend I am fixing a bug in a scala project.&#xA;What you need to survive (and stay sane) in such polyglot software engineering environment is a an IDE that is highly configurable and highly extensible (so that you get all the good stuff (auto-complete, code-navigation, on-the-fly syntax checking, &amp;hellip;).</description>
