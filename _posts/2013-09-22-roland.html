The other day a colleague of mine pointed me to the new website/book from <a href="http://howrolandrolls.com/" target="_blank">Jim Carrey "How Roland rolls"</a> and while looking at it I started to think about my name: What does it mean? What is the origin? What are other well-known usages?<br /><br />Here is what I found out ...

<br /><br /><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/RolandBremen01.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/RolandBremen01.jpg" width="70" /></a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland" target="_blank">Roland</a> was a knight who fought for Charles the Great (also called the father of Europe). His life is the source of legends and his last fight at the Battle of Roncesvalles in 778 was turned into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Song_of_Roland" target="_blank">Song of Roland</a>. In Germany Roland is also famous for the statue on the market place in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bremen_Roland" target="_blank">Bremen</a>. The name of Roland's sword is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durendal" target="_blank">Durendal</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/be/Roland_logo.svg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="29" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/be/Roland_logo.svg" width="200" /></a><a href="http://www.roland.com/" target="_blank">Roland</a> is the name of a japanese maker of music equipment. The company was founded in 1972 and has 3000 employees. A lot of very famous <a href="http://www.rolandus.com/artists/" target="_blank">artists</a> use Roland equipment and you can see a lot of Roland keyboards on stage during live concerts. The rumour is that the company was named after the Song of Roland, &nbsp;apparently the name was just chosen because it was easy to pronounce and stands out easily on trade-shows.<br /><br /><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Bogenoffsetmaschine-1-1980.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Bogenoffsetmaschine-1-1980.jpg" width="176" /></a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manroland" target="_blank">Roland</a> is the name of a company that produces printing machines. It belongs to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAN_SE" target="_blank">MAN group</a>. My father used to work for <a href="http://www.mabeg-systems.de/Stations_of_our_history.php" target="_blank">Mabeg</a>. Mabeg was producing "Bogenanleger" (Sheet-Feeder) and "Querschneider" for Roland printing machines in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offenbach_am_Main" target="_blank">Offenbach</a>. I do not know why the founders (Faber &amp; Schleicher) called their first printing machine Roland. It is said, because it is easy to pronounce.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Garros_(aviator)" target="_blank">Roland</a> Garros was an early French aviator and a fighter pilot during World War I. Stade <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros" target="_blank">Roland</a> Garros is a tennis stadium in Paris, France, which is named after him. The French Open are played there.<br /><br />Here are a couple more people that I know that are called Roland. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Emmerich" target="_blank">Roland</a> Emmerich (Director), <a href="http://www.rolandberger.com/" target="_blank">Roland</a> Berger (Consulting),&nbsp;<a href="http://jumper.wikia.com/wiki/Roland_Cox" target="_blank">Roland</a> Cox (the valiant in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumper_(film)" target="_blank">Jumper</a>, played by Samuel L. Jackson), <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rolandtritsch/9849543595/" target="_blank">Roland</a> Schnir (a friend from mine from the IONA days), <a href="http://stayfriends.berlinonline.de/Personen/Offenbach-am-Main/Roland-Loew-P-8LJ1N-P" target="_blank">Roland</a> Loew (a friend from school) and now last, but not least <a href="http://howrolandrolls.com/" target="_blank">Roland</a> the wave who’s afraid that, one day, when he hits the beach, his life will be over. But when he gets deep, he’s struck by the notion that he’s not just a wave — he’s the whole big, wide ocean!<br /><br />I like the last one :).<br />
