> About the Life of The Extreme Digital Nomad (TEDN). Builder and runner of functional teams and functional systems. Explorer of extreme digital nomading and remote-first cultures.

My name is Roland Tritsch. I am `The Extreme Digital Nomad (TEDN)`. I
am a Software Craftsman and I am applying my craft to building and
maintaining beautiful Software Gardens. I am also a Manager. And a
Husband and a Father. I like to make engineers grow and users smile. I
like computer science. I believe that computers and software can help
to make this planet a better place. When I am not building, running or
fixing something (preferably using a functional programming language
like Haskell or Scala), I am on a hike (somewhere).
