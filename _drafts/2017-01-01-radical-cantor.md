title: Radical Cantor ... how to make it work?
---
It is no secret: I like Radical Cantor!

For me there is no other way to give feedback. Or more specifically: The other 3 options ...

* Not-direct/no-empathy
* Direct/no-empathy
* Not-direct/with-empathy

... do create bad results. Believe me. I tried it. I have done it. I have seen it. Right and wrong.

The only thing that works is direct feedback with a lot of empathy.

And the other day I found/saw a tweet that highlighted to me again, that this is easier said than done, because it all comes down to trust and authenticy.

For Radical Cantor to work people need to trust you. They need to know and feel that the person that gives the feedback has good intentions. And these intentions need to be anchored in the purpose of the endeavour. One key intention is to deliver on the mission of the endeavour. If something gets in the way of delivering on the mission, the person delivering the feedback must have earned the right and trust to talk about it.

The best way to earn that right is to show behaviour in public that will allow poeple to see yout intentions in action. Never attack a person. Always talk about specific actions and behaviours and how they hurt the mission (and suggest (or demand) a different kind of behaviour).
