title: Link of the Month - TwitterFeed
---

In the last two month I have put some work into my online presence (<a href="http://www.tritsch.org">website</a>, <a href="http://www.tritsch.org/Blog/Blog.html">blog</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/rolandtritsch">twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/rolandtritsch">linked-in</a>, ...). Obviously I try to minimize the maintenance effort for me, but maximize the user experience for the "customers" of my online presence (I am talking about you, dear reader :)). <div><br /></div><div>One great tool in this regard is <a href="http://twitterfeed.com">TwitterFeed</a>. It allows you to create "feeds", which will "listen" on RSS feeds and will then turn them into tweets. An obvious use case is to create a "listener" on your own block and make sure your followers learn when you publish a new blog entry.</div><div><br /></div><div>A more sophisticated, integrated (and wwwwaaaayyyyy cooler) use case is to use NetNewsWire to read your RSS feeds/news/articles and use the integration with <a href="http://delicious.com/rolandtritsch">del.ico.us</a> to bookmark what you read. You then go to TwitterFeed and create a listener on the RSS feed on your del.ico.us account and voila: everytime  you are reading something and bookmark it with del.ico.us a tweet gets generated. Very elegant. I like it.<br /></div><div><br /></div><div>I also added a "My Del.ico.us" widget to my blog (on the right hand side), which means that my reading list will also get updated automatically.</div><div><br /></div><div>Check it out. Let me know, if there are more better ways to integrate your online presence.</div><div><br /></div>
