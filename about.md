My name is Roland Tritsch. I am a Software Engineer. I am a Manager. I am a Husband and a Father. I like to make engineers grow and customers/users smile. I like computer science. I believe that computers and software can help to make this place a better place. When I am not building, running or fixing things, I am on a hike (somewhere).
