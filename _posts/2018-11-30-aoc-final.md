title: Advent of Code ... Final cut (... and First cut :))
---
Today [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com) started [again](https://github.com/rolandtritsch/haskell-aoc-2018) (at 05:00am (GMT))!!!

And ...

... just in time ...

... today I am also wrapping up [Advent of Code 2017](https://adventofcode.com/2017)!!!

My first implementation was (obviously) in [Scala](https://github.com/rolandtritsch/scala-aoc-2017).

And that one alone was interesting, because I also used [ScalaCheck](https://www.scalacheck.org) for property-based testing and [ScalaMeter](https://scalameter.github.io) to implement performance tests for all solutions.

I then made the Scala code [cross-compile](https://github.com/portable-scala/sbt-crossproject) with [ScalaNative](http://www.scala-native.org/en/v0.3.8).

At the time I was also learning [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) and spend some cycles to port the code to [Kotlin](https://github.com/rolandtritsch/kotlin-aoc-2018).

With that I had enough for a first initial [benchmark](https://github.com/rolandtritsch/scala-aoc-2017/blob/master/README.md#benchmark).

The disclaimer still applies: I have not spend a lot of time on analysing the behaviour(s) and/or tunning the solutions, means some of the numbers (probably) need to be taken with a grain of salt.

Last but not least (in the last 4 weeks) I implemented/ported the solutions to [Haskell](https://github.com/rolandtritsch/haskell-aoc-2017) and ... [Eta](https://github.com/rolandtritsch/eta-aoc-2017)!!!

I did not make any changes to the Haskell code, means some of the Eta solutions do not work (run out of memory or stack or ... time), but in general I was pleasently surprised how well Eta works and performs.

Last year 43000 people got 2 stars on Day 1. Only 4413 cracked all problems. My claim to fame is that I am (probably) the only one with implementations in 3 languages :).

I updated the [benchmark sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kHugZ-8mJczlmQRcda23YGvAgeqlJLt1I7cYlDD3Tws/edit?usp=sharing) and I am hoping that people will find the code useful.
