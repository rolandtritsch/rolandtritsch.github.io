Stumbled over James's blog entry about <a href="http://macstrac.blogspot.com/2007/07/my-favourite-os-x-software.html">useful software for the Mac </a>and added <a href="http://growl.info/">Growl</a> to my list of software that you need have/use to be effective, but was not able to make it work with X-Chat (AquaChat). Confronted with the option to figure out what is wrong or to try something new, I took the easy way out: I tried Colloquy. This worked out of the box. I know need to find out how to make my Twitter tweeds show up in Growl.
