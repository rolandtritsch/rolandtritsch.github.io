Clearly ... and obviously ... the idea of [Software Gardening](http://www.artima.com/intv/garden.html) is not mine. But as I have already mentioned [once](http://www.tritsch.org/2013/02/16/about-broken-windows-and-software.html) or [twice](http://www.tritsch.org/reveal-presentations/software-gardening_2016-10-28/meetup.html) ... I like it a lot.

And it is also something that we have [adopted here at Nitro Engineering](https://engineering.gonitro.com/our-values/) as a guiding principle for our daily actions and daily habits.

In general software architecture is something that you cannot *see* or *touch*, but in October I had the engineering managers in Dublin and that chance was just too good to not use it, means we all hoped on a bus and went to see [the **real thing!!!**](http://powerscourt.com/gardens)

We found our data lake ...

... and the message bus that leads to it ...

When we found the [Japenese Garden](http://powerscourt.com/gardens/japanese-garden) in Powerscourt Gardens we discussed architectures in architectures (sub-architectures) and that this can work as long it is confined and does not *bleed* into the rest of the garden ...

... and at the end we fixed a [broken window](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-broken-window-theory/), because we found some litter on this piece of grass, ...

... picked it up and left the garden in better shape than we found it.

A day to remember ...
