      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Lencioni&#34;&gt;Patrick Lencioni&lt;/a&gt; (obviously) wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team&#34;&gt;The Five Dysfunctions&#xA;of a Team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b6/The5dysfunctionsofateam.png&#34; style=&#34;float:right; margin:auto&#34; width=&#34;20%&#34; hspace=&#34;5%&#34; vspace=&#34;1%&#34;/&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In that book we learn that the five dysfunctions you need to avoid are&#xA;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Absence of trust — unwilling to be vulnerable within the group&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fear of conflict — seeking artificial harmony over constructive&#xA;passionate debate&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lack of commitment — feigning buy-in for group decisions creates&#xA;ambiguity throughout the organization&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Avoidance of accountability — ducking the responsibility to call&#xA;peers, superiors on counterproductive behavior which sets low&#xA;standards&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Inattention to team results — focusing on personal success, status&#xA;and ego before team success&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I always try to frame these in positive/actionable terms by asking&#xA;people to help me to build teams that show/exhibit the following&#xA;characteristics &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is better than Remote-First 1.0? Remote-First 2.0!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago I got my second jab. I am fully vaccinated now. I am now in Germany to see my parents for the first time in 12 month.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes: It is finally happening! The pandemic (slowly, but surely) comes to an end.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which creates (for some of us and for some companies) a big question: What&amp;rsquo;s the next step? What&amp;rsquo;s the path forward (e.g. from a organisational structure/development point of view)?. We all work from home right now (if we want it or not). Do we want to continue to work from home (double-down on remote-first)? Or go back to the office (revitalize a hub-first office culture)? Or go hybrid?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Distances - Know them. Manage them.</title>
      <link>http://tedn.life/2021/06/01/distances-know-them.-manage-them./</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Building and managing remote-first organizations means that you also need to understand (and manage) distances!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To develop your ability to understand and manage distances is very important because human beings naturally need closeness (to other people and/or the purpose of the endeavor) to feel a sense of belonging.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But &amp;hellip; wait a sec: What do you mean by &lt;strong&gt;distances&lt;/strong&gt; (plural)? Is there more than one?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Big surprise: Yes! When I build and run remote-first organizations I worry about and manage at least the following distances &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As people know &amp;hellip; I am big fan of building and maintain this&#xA;balance between Product and Engineering where &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:center; font-weight:bold; border:2px solid;&#xA;border-radius: 10px; padding:10px; margin-left:80px; margin-right:80px;&#xA;background-color:gainsboro&#34;&gt;&#xA;Product makes sure we build the right thing &lt;br&gt;&#xA;and &lt;br&gt;&#xA;Engineering makes sure we built it right &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;(and we help each other to do so :))&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But that is only the start. The real magic happens when we get to a&#xA;point where we are not &lt;a href=&#34;https://tedn.life/2017/06/12/productive-friction-and-diversity-...-the-pillars-of-innovation-...-or-how-to-not-build-faster-horses/&#34;&gt;building faster horses&lt;/a&gt;. If the&#xA;conversation goes &lt;strong&gt;wrong&lt;/strong&gt; it goes like this &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What&#39;s a Staff Director?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://community.com&#34;&gt;Community&lt;/a&gt; is growing fast.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More business. More customers. More people. More money. More (necessary) complexity (software and people).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;http://tedn.life/images/2020-08-31-staff-director/roland.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;float: left;&#34; width=&#34;30%&#34; height=&#34;30%&#34; hspace=&#34;30&#34; vspace=&#34;10&#34;/&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The demand for this kind of growth can create a lot of interesting strains, problems and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In situations like this it is easy to end up between a rock and a hard place: Grow fast and run a/the risk that the growing pains will kill you or end up being too slow to fully capitalize on the magnitude of the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Discussing Remote ... the book!!!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rte.ie/brainstorm/2020/0309/1121062-guide-to-working-from-home/&#34;&gt;These days&lt;/a&gt; people look for advice and insight into &lt;strong&gt;how to build and run a remote-first engineering organization&lt;/strong&gt;. And want/need to learn &lt;strong&gt;fast&lt;/strong&gt;!!!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41BvQsIufOL.jpg&#34;/&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One good resource is (obviously) &lt;a href=&#34;https://basecamp.com/books/remote&#34;&gt;Remote&lt;/a&gt; (kind of the bible on working remote).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The book was published in 2013 (and was probably written in the 12 month before that).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously the key messages/statements from the book are still true (or truer than ever), but I think that since then things have also changed and evolved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last 25 years I have build and run multiple distributed software engineering organisations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://scontent-lhr8-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/s150x150/72219877_2627575297329784_2204594876106932224_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-1.cdninstagram.com&amp;_nc_ohc=Vy_M1qhQPR4AX9VvKEh&amp;oh=55fc6ae9e53bf69f1e42ef0480497680&amp;oe=5EAD08F4&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My management style/philosophy is based on a couple of core believes &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tritsch.org/reveal-the-power/why.html&#34;&gt;The Power of Why&lt;/a&gt; - I like to lead with &lt;strong&gt;Why&lt;/strong&gt; (to make sure &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TAqSBMZDY8&#34;&gt;Talent and Passion can meet a Purpose&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;People first - I always think and feel that people are the solution (not the problem)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Heterogenerity for the win - You have to be different to complement each other (and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tritsch.org/2017/06/12/productive.html&#34;&gt;to create innovation&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;No surprises - Everybody (at all times) should be clear on what is happening and why it is happening, which leads to &amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building and maintain trust (and respect) (between the people) at all cost!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the end it is simple. To be successful you need to &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hub-First vs. Remote-First vs. Pod-First ... Skating to where the puck is going to be</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course&#34;&gt;MOOCs&lt;/a&gt; (Massive Open Online Courses) are massive!!!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I did my first one 7 years ago (on Cousera; Martin Odersky&amp;rsquo;s course on Functional Programming with Scala).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since then there has been an explosion of sites and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course&#34;&gt;offerings&lt;/a&gt;. By now it is clear that, if you do not know, how to use these sites to your own advantage you are putting yourself at a competitive disadvantage (from a skills development point of view).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>About being a (software development) manager ... and managing energy!!!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot has been written and said about what you need to do as a manager or more specifically as a manager of a software development team/group/organisation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You need to understand people and the business and technology (software engineering processes and practices, tools and frameworks, programming languages, &amp;hellip;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You need to be a manager and a leader. You need to be a friend and a dad (or mother) and a boss.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hackweeks @ Nitro ... The Why, The What, The How</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As already discussed: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tritsch.org/2017/06/12/productive.html&#34;&gt;I am obsessed with building cars&lt;/a&gt;!!!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not in the sense that I want/need to build cars, but in the sense that Henry Ford famously once upon a time (&lt;a href=&#34;https://hbr.org/2011/08/henry-ford-never-said-the-fast&#34;&gt;apparently not&lt;/a&gt;) said, that if he would have build what customers wanted, he would have build faster horses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://tedn.life/images/2017-06-12-productive/yin-yang.png&#34; alt=&#34;Yin-Yang&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Luckily he was able to complement the input from the customers (we want faster horses) with a view of what is possible (cars). I am convinced that it is one the responsibilities of the engineering organization in a product and technology company to provide this view. Hence my focus on building organizations that foster creativity and allow innovation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Leadership at Amazon ... Productive Friction 2.0</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The other day I was reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312517120198/d373368dex991.htm&#34;&gt;the letter&lt;/a&gt; that Jeff Bezo&amp;rsquo;s is writing to shareholders every year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The obsession with fast, good decision making was and is resonating with me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like fast decision making processes that produce good decisions. And I like cultures and behaviors that foster environments that produce these fast, good decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the case of Amazon they have developed a set of &lt;a href=&#34;https://jobs.amazon.cn/en/principles&#34;&gt;leadership principles&lt;/a&gt; and behaviors (like the famous &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.inc.com/business-insider/jeff-bezos-productivity-tip-two-pizza-rule.html&#34;&gt;2 pizza rule&lt;/a&gt;) to protect their agility and velocity, while they are scaling (and to make sure they stay a Day 1 company).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the week of Jul., 10th &lt;a href=&#34;https://engineering.gonitro.com/our-values/&#34;&gt;we&lt;/a&gt; are going to do our next Hackweek.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The concept is not new. A lot of companies do it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://assets.amuniversal.com/18af4b30fba0012e2fbe00163e41dd5b&#34; alt=&#34;Dilbert on Hackweek&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question is: Why is it valuable?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For me the answer is: Because you want to make sure you are not building faster horses!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://hbr.org/2011/08/henry-ford-never-said-the-fast&#34;&gt;Henry Ford once famously said (or not said :))&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;ldquo;If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes for me discussions about Operational Excellence sound like discussions about teenager sex: Everybody is talking about it, nobody &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other day I was wondering again: What is Operational Excellence and why should you have it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For me &lt;strong&gt;Operational Excellence is the ability of an organization to make (initially small and then over time bigger and bigger) promises and keep them consistently and reliably within budget (time and money)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year we visited some of our customers in EMEA to get some video footage about their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gonitro.com/enterprise/?page=customer-success-template&amp;amp;template=howden&#34;&gt;Nitro Experience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/0xcvC49mYk8&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While we had our Creative Director in town (in Dublin), we also decided to shoot some material for some internal videos. Ooohhh &amp;hellip; the fun we had &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/YpNdC0R6om4&#34;&gt;Life at Nitro: The Nitro Family&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/otIJqD6vTwY&#34;&gt;Life Nitro: Our Dedication to Development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/Q4PznC0WRw4&#34;&gt;Life at Nitro: Our Diversity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/hx4UJJ0GvzU&#34;&gt;Nitro: Our Vision for PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/aes30-dBKRI&#34;&gt;Life at Nitro: Our Leaders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/BZ61NBcmNyU&#34;&gt;Nitro: Our Thoughts on Printers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My favorite quote is &amp;hellip; obviously &amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;Printers suck!!!&amp;rdquo;. I am with Nitro now for 18 month, but have not configured the office printer yet and have no intentions to do so any time soon, because &amp;hellip; &lt;see above&gt; &amp;hellip; and the damn thing is most of the time in the state that most printers are all the time: Broken and/or not working for reasons that I am not able to comprehend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finding a good and maybe even the right org structure for an engineering organization is something of a dark art.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Initially everything is so easy. 5-10 engineers are in one location, have one boss, work on the one thing and have one common skill.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But then you are successful. And you hire more engineers and then you realize that to derisk the hiring and the growth you probably want to hire in more than one location and then a couple of engineers will leave, because the people management aspect of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/mikebrittain/from-building-a-marketplace-to-building-teams&#34;&gt;being an engineering manager&lt;/a&gt; is not something that comes naturally to most of us. Oh dear &amp;hellip; and then things get &amp;hellip; &lt;strong&gt;interesting&lt;/strong&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are redoing our &lt;a href=&#34;https://engineering.gonitro.com&#34;&gt;engineering website&lt;/a&gt; and our blog (stay tuned).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In parallel we have worked on the Nitro Mission Statement (for 2017 and beyond) and have condensed it down to &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://tedn.life/images/2016-11-11-mission/mission.png&#34; alt=&#34;Nitro Mission Statement&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gonitro.com/about/team&#34;&gt;VP Product&lt;/a&gt; has also articulated a comprehensive, 2-step, &amp;ldquo;Elon Musk&amp;rdquo;-style master plan how to get there &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Make edit, collaborate, share, sign &amp;hellip; work!!! - for everybody (personal and business (wall-to-wall)), everywhere (desktop, browser, mobile) and anytime (always-on).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Make it smart(er).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Going through this process made me think (again): Why do I work for Nitro?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Clearly &amp;hellip; and obviously &amp;hellip; the idea of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.artima.com/intv/garden.html&#34;&gt;Software Gardening&lt;/a&gt; is not mine. But as I have already mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tritsch.org/2013/02/16/about-broken-windows-and-software.html&#34;&gt;once&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tritsch.org/reveal-presentations/software-gardening_2016-10-28/meetup.html&#34;&gt;twice&lt;/a&gt; &amp;hellip; I like it a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And it is also something that we have &lt;a href=&#34;https://engineering.gonitro.com/our-values/&#34;&gt;adopted here at Nitro Engineering&lt;/a&gt; as a guiding principle for our daily actions and daily habits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://tedn.life/images/2016-10-28-software-gardening/garden.png&#34; alt=&#34;PCG&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general software architecture is something that you cannot &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;touch&lt;/em&gt;, but in October I had the engineering managers in Dublin and that chance was just too good to not use it, means we all hoped on a bus and went to see &lt;a href=&#34;http://powerscourt.com/gardens&#34;&gt;the &lt;strong&gt;real thing!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I had a good day in the office!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nitro (like a lot of other startups) is going through growing pains. In the last 2 years we have hired a lot of people (and have not been able to retain all of them). We have build a lot of systems, platforms, features and products (and some of it turned into technical debt faster than we wanted). We implemented processes and practices (and not all of them made us more productive or faster).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Got very positive feedback on &lt;a href=&#34;http://tech.gilt.com/post/66553349381/immutability-and-innovation-gilt-the-perfect-storm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;what we are doing&lt;/a&gt;. Did meet a lot of people with very interesting ideas (e.g. my friend &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rnEx9pfR3s&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Klaus&lt;/a&gt; (see below)). &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.newrelic.com/2013/10/24/introducing-software-analytics/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Lew&#39;s keynote on Rubicon&lt;/a&gt; was insightful and inspiring. Kate was talking on the art of self-management and Peter talked about how to run hundreds of Postgres databases for Heroku. Checking out &lt;a href=&#34;http://futurestack.io/videos&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; (and all of the the other talks) is recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MmhlfLIj8WY/UoIEmDLAHDI/AAAAAAAAAJw/chfDVS3hlKs/s1600/IMG_3028.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MmhlfLIj8WY/UoIEmDLAHDI/AAAAAAAAAJw/chfDVS3hlKs/s320/IMG_3028.JPG&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://tedn.life/2013/09/24/gilt-cio-talks-...-about-innovation/</guid>
      <description>From an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.logicworks.net/blog/2013/09/cloud-player-steve-jacobs-cio-gilt-groupe-part-1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gilt.com/company/bio/steve-jacobs&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Steve&lt;/a&gt;. Too good not to turn it into a blog post ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;When people talk about innovation they are often talking about the solution to some problem. But the real source of innovation is figuring out what the right problem is to solve. Take Gilt for example: Gilt took the invite only friends &amp;amp; family sample sale invite that existed for coveted brands in cities like New York and moved that model online. &amp;nbsp;This allowed consumers all over the US to have access to designer apparel and accessories for a short period of time, similar to a two day offline sample sale, and it allowed the brands to have another outlet to sell end of season merchandise. &amp;nbsp;Gilt was perfectly positioned to meet both the brand’s needs and the customer’s needs. The identification of the problem is the hardest part. The solution, once you’ve identified the problem, tends to be pretty easy. If you give any set of engineers a problem, they’ll figure out a solution with confidence. But really, picking which problems to go after in a world of limited resources is where the magic of innovation happens. I think often times people focus on a solution or cool technology that’s really innovative, but it’s only innovative if it solves a substantial problem.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True, true, true, ... let&#39;s continue to find and pick the right problems!!!</description>

      <title>Getting GTD done - Thoughts and Tools</title>
      <link>http://tedn.life/2013/08/19/getting-gtd-done-thoughts-and-tools/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://tedn.life/2013/08/19/getting-gtd-done-thoughts-and-tools/</guid>
      <description>We all have a lot to do. Effective time/task management is essential. I’ve been using GTD (Getting Things Done) for a while now (a long while :)) and for me it comes down to the question, “How do you pick the next, best, most valuable thing to work on?”—basically answering the question of how to make the best use of the time you have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picking something from your list of urgent things to do is kind of easy, but how can you make sure you are not missing the opportunity/chance to work on something important, if you get the chance to do so?&#xA;&#xA;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy! Just do &lt;a href=&#34;http://inboxzero.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Inbox-Zero&lt;/a&gt; and use &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GTD&lt;/a&gt; (Getting Things Done), read the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;7 Habbits of highly effective people&lt;/a&gt; and work through the stuff in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.43folders.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;43folders&lt;/a&gt; and ... problem solved, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aim of this blog post is to share some of my thoughts on how to become effective or even better maybe only become more effective than you are today and what tools to use and how to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First let&#39;s be clear: It all starts with yourself. You need to be clear and serious about what you want to get out of life and what is important to you. The stuff above will help you to get organized, but it will not make you happy (at least this is true for myself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What has helped me is to think about golf balls. You know? &lt;a href=&#34;http://theocgproject.com/2012/11/20/golf-balls-pebbles-and-beer-an-analogy-for-life-by-author-unknown/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The story&lt;/a&gt; about the professor that teaches philosophy and is pouring sand and beer into a bucket? Means every 6 to 12 month I am making sure to set aside half a day with a friend or on my own and think about the golf balls that need to go into the bucket. Sometimes I am adding one (easy), but then I am also making sure that I am removing one (hard). I try not to have more than 5 golf balls in the bucket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other good way to look at it is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gtdtimes.com/2011/01/26/the-6-horizons-of-focus/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&#34;flight-level&#34; approach&lt;/a&gt; that is suggested by David Allen to put structure into GTD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here comes the first tip or trick: Originally I had all of that in one place (e.g. your GTD tool of choice). For me personally that was bad in 2 ways: First, I was looking at it way too often and second, the list-view way of looking at my purpose, vision, goals just did not resonate with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of years ago I started to maintain my high(er) level believes (e.g. 50k, 40k, 30k) in a very expressive and colourful &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;mindmap&lt;/a&gt;. To maintain the mindmap I am using &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeMind&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FreeMind&lt;/a&gt;. And then I am printing it and put it somewhere, where I can see it (at home). This works very well for me. I look at it a lot and most of the time it makes me smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Means I am using my GTD tool only for the lower &#34;flight-levels&#34; and the runway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let&#39;s talk a little bit about my GTD tool. I have tried a lot (not naming names), but like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;OmniFocus&lt;/a&gt; most/best. The only big problem with OmniFocus is that it does not support Android. If one of these days I find a tool that is as good as OmniFocus and supports Android, I will switch to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using OmniFocus or any other GTD tool comes with it&#39;s own set of challenges. Most of the time the tools feature a tutorial and suggest a way to use it. In the case of OmniFocus and for me this did not really work well. It took me a while to figure out how to make OmniFocus work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;For me it comes down to one very important question:&lt;/b&gt; Assuming that you are done doing something, how do you pick the next task? And this is where the rubber hits the road and this is where the tutorials start to fail, because this is really something that you have to figure out for yourself. The tutorial might suggest that you need to structure it along the lines of projects or locations (at home, in the office) or if you have your laptop or a phone. For me none of this matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am picking my next task based on urgency and importance. Sounds familiar? So far, so good. As always urgency is easy. Every task got a due date and you just sort the tasks by due date and you will be able to find out what you need get done in the next couple of days. In OmniFocus I am using the Due perspective and that works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I also created a second perspective for myself that I call &lt;b&gt;the Do perspective&lt;/b&gt;. And that perspective helps me to find tasks that I can do that are not necessarily urgent. I thought about this a lot and for me there are two dimensions/questions that I use to pick something from that list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do I need somebody to make progress on this task or can I do it on my own?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How long will this take?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;So let&#39;s say, later in the day and I suddenly have 10m, 30m, 60m or more than 60m to do something and I am done with my urgent list. I then go to my Do list/perspective which is sorted by how long a task will take and find the tasks fit into the time that I have. 10m might be a call, 30m might be to followup with somebody on an important project. In the best case I am picking a big/long task which needs a lot of people, because in general these are difficult ones. In the worst case, either because I do not have a lot of time or because nobody is around/awake, I am picking a short task that I can do on my own. &lt;b&gt;But it is very important to favour the longest possible task and if possible one that requires other people, because to find a slot for a short task that you can do on your own is easy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-J36j4YegC98/UhHd0Ti1UlI/AAAAAAAAAGY/lihJwzKsyyU/s1600/Time+vs.+Need.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-J36j4YegC98/UhHd0Ti1UlI/AAAAAAAAAGY/lihJwzKsyyU/s640/Time+vs.+Need.png&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;To make this work I give every task a duration. I am only using 3 durations: 10m, 30m and 60m (or more). For tasks that I am delegating I am using 100h, because this task has no duration for me. The thing with the 100h is important, so that I can see the tasks that have no duration, which in my case is an indication that something went wrong. If I would use no duration as a valid value, I would not be able to find the tasks that are not configured correctly.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Finally I am using contexts to express, if I need somebody for a task or not. I have two sub-groups: &#34;Need help from ...&#34; and &#34;Waiting for ...&#34;. In &#34;Need help from ...&#34; I have a context call &#34;Nobody&#34; and a long, ever-growing list of people and groups of people that I need to get something done. Means every time I am processing a task in my inbox I decide quickly, if I want/can do this alone/on my own and if so assign it to the &#34;Need help from ... &amp;gt; Nobody&#34; context. Otherwise I pick the person or group I need to make progress with this task. If it is not me who owns the task I am assigning it a person in the &#34;Waiting for ...&#34; sub-group. In that sub-group I only have people, no groups, because when I am delegating something, I am delegating it to a person, not to a group of people. All of the contexts on &#34;Waiting for ...&#34; are configured to be in status &#34;On Hold&#34; and I have a perspective to show me all tasks that I have delegated. Needless to say, when I am delegating a task I set it up in a way so that I do not have to poll for progress, but agree a way of working together so that progress reports and updates are pushed to me.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is how all of this comes together:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most of the time I use the &#34;quick entry&#34; keyboard shortcut or the &#34;Send to OmniFocus&#34; clipping feature to put something into my Inbox. Especially while processing email. More on this later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Once a day I am going through my inbox and give the task a project, a context, a due date and a duration. I do this for every task. This needs to be quick. To make this quick I am using a couple of &#34;short-cuts&#34;/simplifications (features of OmniTi and GTD that I am not using at all or in a different way). This means for instance that I am not thinking about &#34;does this task need a due date or not&#34;. I always give it a due date. If it is not urgent the due date might be in 3 month from now. But this way I have squared it away and have clearly expressed that it is not urgent and that is also important.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another short-cut is that I only have a very small amount of projects. Most of the time I am only using two Single-Action projects. One for my personal tasks and one for my business tasks. This makes finding the right project for a task very fast. I am not using OmniFocus for Project Planning or Project Management (for that I am using OmniPlan). I am mainly using OmniFocus for task management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After that I take a look at my Due perspective and my Do perspective and pick the best task for the first time slot that I have.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;One of my urgent, reoccurring tasks is to clean my EMail-Inbox. I normally do this twice a day. Once in the morning and once in the evening. And I normally do it before I process my GTD-Inbox. But just to give you an idea, I normally have 100 emails in my EMail-Inbox and I process it in 10-15 mins and cleaning up my GTD-Inbox normally takes less than 5 mins. I am very strict not do anything while I am processing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So last, but not least lets talk about email. Again how you are doing your inbox processing or your Inbox-Zero is very much a question of personal taste. My system has 3 labels or folders: NeedsAction, Keep and Archive. The one thing that is important for me is that moving emails to these folders/labels has a keyboard short-cut associated with it. I am using mail.app and it took me a while to figure out how to make this happen, but &lt;a href=&#34;http://support.apple.com/kb/PH3957&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;with Mac OS 10.8 it is possible to assign keys to menu items&lt;/a&gt;, means in my case I have&amp;nbsp;Ctrl-J, Ctrl-K, Ctrl-L assigned to&amp;nbsp;&#34;Message &amp;gt; Move to &amp;gt; NeedsAction&#34;,&amp;nbsp;&#34;Message &amp;gt; Move to &amp;gt; Keep&#34;, &#34;Message &amp;gt; Move to &amp;gt; Archive&#34;. With that I am flying through my inbox very fast. NeedsAction includes everything that takes longer than a minute to do. This includes reading a long email or even responding to an email. Sometimes I start to work on an email, but after a minute I start to feel that this will take 10m or maybe even 30m. At that point I stop working on that email and just put it into NeedsAction. In a second pass I am going through the NeedsAction folder and either do it or turn it into a GTD task (including the tasks I want to delegate). I do it this way to make sure that I do not keep tasks in my email. If I am not strict on this, then I start to maintain 2 lists, which makes picking the next best task hard(er).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ssssoooo ... that&#39;s about it!!! This is how I get things done with GTD. As I said most of it is a question of personal style. My style is maybe more task/action oriented than other people. Maybe other people prefer to think about what needs to get done more in the context of projects, but what have described here works for me. But this might be the most important take away from this post: Create a task to really think about how you are getting things done and what information you need to make good decisions on what task to tackle next. Spending an hour on it and implementing it afterwards, might be a good investment in your future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Last but not least, I would love to hear from you how you use/organise your projects and contexts in OmniFocus or any other tool you are using.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am now going to take a look at my Due and Do perspective to pick something that I can do in the next 30 mins, before I have to go to my next meeting.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Charting some KPIs ... how hard can it be?</title>

      <description>In the last couple of weeks I was working on an initiative to make all the &lt;a href=&#34;http://tech.gilt.com/post/44792645000/scaling-agile-at-gilt-with-teams-ingredients&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gilt Tech KPIs&lt;/a&gt; available in one place. There are lots of dashboard solutions available, but nothing really did what we wanted it to do or it was clumsy to use. At the end we decided to build a small &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.playframework.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Scala Play&lt;/a&gt; app to get what we want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As part of that exercise we had to find a way to visualise the history of the KPI values (timestamp, value pairs) and I started to play around with charting frameworks and figured it makes sense to write up what I have found out. The list of solutions is kind of arbitrary and is by all-means not aiming to be a complete list of available charting frameworks, but gives you a glimpse of what is out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The source code is available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rolandtritsch/web-kpi&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my Github account&lt;/a&gt;. Feel free to clone the repo and play around with it yourself.&amp;nbsp;There are 4 &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rolandtritsch/web-kpi/tags&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;tagged versions&lt;/a&gt; available ...&#xA;&#xA;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;v0.1 - Featuring charting based on sfreechart&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;v0.2 - Featuring charting based on highchart&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;v0.3 - Featuring charting based on D3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;v0.4 - Featuring charting based on chartjs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;After you have cloned the repo you can checkout the version you are interested in and start the server as described in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rolandtritsch/web-kpi/blob/master/README.md&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;README&lt;/a&gt;. Let&#39;s go through them one by one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with a very simple server based charting solution called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/wookietreiber/scala-chart&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SFreeChart&lt;/a&gt;. It is Scala wrapper around &lt;a href=&#34;http://jfree.org/jfreechart/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;JFreeChart&lt;/a&gt;. I was able to get that up and running very fast, but realised very quickly that it would not give me what I want, because I do not want to manage the files on the server side and the chart is not interactive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-h7RNK6i_-Pw/UY3Y3aNe0aI/AAAAAAAAAEc/vObMEsSwDTE/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-05-10+at+16.42.30.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-h7RNK6i_-Pw/UY3Y3aNe0aI/AAAAAAAAAEc/vObMEsSwDTE/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-05-10+at+16.42.30.png&#34; height=&#34;395&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp;KPI charted with SFreeChart&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: While I was looking into how to manage the files on the server side I found &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jsuereth/scala-arm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Scala automatic resource management&lt;/a&gt;, which is a very nice way to make sure that you always manage/close your resources (e.g. file descriptors, database connections, ...). Recommended. Take a look at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;http://tech.gilt.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gilt&lt;/a&gt; we are using &lt;a href=&#34;http://gatling-tool.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gatling&lt;/a&gt; to do our load and performance testing. The Gatling charts are very nice and are based on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.highcharts.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Highcharts&lt;/a&gt;, a charting solution from &lt;a href=&#34;http://highsoft.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Highsoft&lt;/a&gt;. Highcharts is free for non-commercial use. For commercial use, you have to get a &lt;a href=&#34;http://shop.highsoft.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;license&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highcharts is awesome! To get into it you can use &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.highcharts.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the online documentation&lt;/a&gt; or you can read&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.packtpub.com/learning-highcharts-for-javascript-data-visualization/book&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the book&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;API online documentation&lt;/a&gt; is very well done. It has lots of examples and links to &lt;a href=&#34;http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/jquery/1.7.2/highslide-software/highcharts.com/tree/master/samples/highcharts/chart/reflow-true/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;jsFiddle&lt;/a&gt; and lets you experiment with the framework. The book is very well structured and is a must read, if you want to get serious about Highcharts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ySY6kESncpg/UY3Y3XurHfI/AAAAAAAAAEY/ZOLCsVaQc78/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-05-10+at+15.36.21.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ySY6kESncpg/UY3Y3XurHfI/AAAAAAAAAEY/ZOLCsVaQc78/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-05-10+at+15.36.21.png&#34; height=&#34;438&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;KPI charted with HighChart&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that made me keep on looking was the license fee for commercial use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I looked at&lt;a href=&#34;http://d3js.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt; D3 (Data-Driven Documents)&lt;/a&gt;. D3 is not really a charting framework. It is much bigger, much more powerful. It allows you to visualise data in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;any way imaginable&lt;/a&gt;. It is unbelievable what you can do with D3!!! But ... the flexibility comes at a price. For me the best way to look at it is the way Git is structured: If Highcharts is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://git-scm.com/book/ch9-1.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;porcelain&lt;/a&gt; of charting then D3 is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://git-scm.com/book/ch9-1.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;pluming&lt;/a&gt;. D3 is raw. There is nothing you cannot do, but you have to do it (lots of pixel pushing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-24OVR79_uns/UY3Y3Jl-4WI/AAAAAAAAAEU/Xg0s9sol2G8/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-05-10+at+16.37.00.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-24OVR79_uns/UY3Y3Jl-4WI/AAAAAAAAAEU/Xg0s9sol2G8/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-05-10+at+16.37.00.png&#34; height=&#34;334&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;KPI charted with D3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end I was looking for a client-side, license-free, easy-to-use charting framework and stumbled of the new kid on the blog: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chartjs.org/&#34;&gt;Chart.js&lt;/a&gt;. Chart.js is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/news/2013/03/chartjs-v.0.1-released&#34;&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; and I was able to make it work in half an hour. For now it seems to fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3OidBo7ST-E/UY3Y4KSLPTI/AAAAAAAAAEs/DEJX-i3BBN4/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-05-10+at+19.22.25.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3OidBo7ST-E/UY3Y4KSLPTI/AAAAAAAAAEs/DEJX-i3BBN4/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-05-10+at+19.22.25.png&#34; height=&#34;436&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;KPI charted with Chart.js&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said this is by no means an all-inclusive review of all available charting solutions. All discussed solutions and approaches have their merits. It comes down to your requirements to decide what is the right one for you.</description>

      <title>Dublin Innovation Festival - Talking about Innovation, Gilt and Ireland ... and Evolution and Darwinism</title>

      <guid>http://tedn.life/2011/11/24/dublin-innovation-festival-talking-about-innovation-gilt-and-ireland-...-and-evolution-and-darwinism/</guid>
      <description>&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SKu1QBbZHOw/Ts5wRNhbAPI/AAAAAAAAAUQ/n0NNY_QoLzE/s1600/Diversity_Matters_photo_without_wording_.jpg&#34; onblur=&#34;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;A couple of weeks ago I had the chance to talk about three things I care about: Innovation, Gilt and Ireland. The occasion was the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.innovationdublin.ie/festival/2011/view_event/ID259/&#34;&gt;Dublin Chamber of Commerce Smart Series Event on Innovation&lt;/a&gt; (that was the day after Dundrum Shopping Center and half of Dublin got &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OWG_XjmLNQ&#34;&gt;flooded&lt;/a&gt;). The objective was to share a couple of thoughts on what innovation is (or is not), what Gilt is doing to foster innovation and what Ireland has to offer to companies like Gilt.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;To start ... Innovation is probably on all our minds. If you get it right as an individual or as a company or as a country, you create a differentiator for yourself. Everybody wants to be innovative. The main point of the talk was to point out the &lt;b&gt;similarities between innovation and evolution.&lt;/b&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style=&#34;float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 133px; height: 200px;&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8gs1e4uZGog/TrhNBkJH6cI/AAAAAAAAAR0/U9s3UzZ1fp8/s200/sally-gap-wicklow-county-ireland-r115-21222196.jpg&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; id=&#34;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5672368419950291394&#34; /&gt;There are lots of definitions available, but one way to think about innovation is in terms of the hard and the brain. The hard tells us that innovation is this wonderful thing that happens in the shower or in my case on the bike on the way up to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mapmyride.com/s/routes/view/bike-ride-map/ireland/kildare/885363&#34;&gt;Sally Gap&lt;/a&gt;, when you have this moment of brilliance for the next best, bigger business idea that will actually change the world. And then we look at individuals like Steve Jobs, who are obviously either showering a lot or who know the way up to Sally Gap like the back of their hands, because it seems they innovate everyday and we start to wonder what is wrong with us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;The short answer is actually: nothing. Nothing, because in my opinion it does not work this way. Even in the case of the iPod you could argue that the real innovation was the Sony Walkman and the iPod was a refinement on the original idea.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style=&#34;float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 156px; height: 200px;&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NIH8w4fcdYs/TrhN7Hxmd_I/AAAAAAAAASA/Y2-ppMip7Cs/s200/charles_darwin_01.jpg&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; id=&#34;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5672369408767850482&#34; /&gt;&lt;div&gt;The more rational definition behind innovation is that innovation is not a thing or an event that &#34;happens&#34;. It is the result of a process. I am personally a big fan of evolution and Darwinism. There is only so much you can plan and/or foresee. For the rest you have to try (a lot) and see what works. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;That sounds easy, but it isn&#39;t, because it is counterintuitive. You have to embrace mutation and selection. You first have to create a &#34;creative&#34; environment that produces a lot of (hopefully) good, new ideas and then you have to filter them and needs to happen early, because being innovative does not mean to be just creative. It means to be successful and that means it is not about creating a lot of good, new ideas, it is also about finding the ones that make a difference for your business and for your customers and if your are lucky for your industry.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Not to a small extend it is this “bi-polar” nature of innovation that makes it difficult for us to implement innovation. Just think about it: On one hand you ask people to mutate (means to come up with a lot of good, new ideas) and to be passionate about these ideas and then you need to have strong selection in place to kill most of them. If you do it wrong it will frustrate people, because they might get the impression that nobody is listening and innovation will just stop to happen.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;In a lot cases we fail to get good innovation because we either mutate too much and do not select enough or the other way around. Good innovative environments show both characteristics: A lot of mutation and strong selection. &lt;b&gt;Innovation is the evolution of ideas. It is Darwinism of ideas. It is the survival of the fittest idea.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;To create such an environment and to maybe avoid the frustration mentioned above, you should reward people equally for coming up with an idea and also for giving up on an idea. Failure must become an option and maybe even something that you should or could celebrate.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Let&#39;s talk about Gilt. Gilt is innovative. Let me talk about two examples that will illustrate how innovation based on strong selective pressure  (means a well-defined niche that you need to adapt to) and/or strong mutation (means a good idea) can look like.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zhsSpr5dwtw/TrhPSKiDnyI/AAAAAAAAASM/9jrn5zHvyo0/s200/Hackathon.png&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; id=&#34;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5672370904156577570&#34; style=&#34;float: left; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 146px; &#34; /&gt;The first example I want to talk about is inventory management. Normal retail business models allow you to do inventory management based on thresholds, means as soon as your inventory goes beyond a certain threshold you reorder. When you reorder has something to do with your lead times and also with the quality of your inventory management, means you actually do not care, if there is a little bit more or little bit less in stock, as long as you never run out of stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Gilt business model requires a totally different approach. Because in most cases we are selling excess stock, 80% of all products we have ever sold we have sold only once, means we never really can reorder and that &lt;b&gt;means we are in the business of selling down to the very last unit. Always!!!&lt;/b&gt; And we need to do that while we maintain highest possible availability and scalability. To deliver on these business requirements we had to question conventional wisdom and build a very innovative inventory management runtime platform, based on highly available and highly scalable NoSQL databases that actually relax some of the transactional ACID properties, but still allows us to sell down to the very last unit. And we succeeded. That’s an example for innovation out of necessity to adapt to a niche.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;The second example for an innovation at Gilt is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xna2YVgXY7c&#34;&gt;360 degree &#34;look-around&#34; Jetsetter iPad app.&lt;/a&gt; The application allows you to take a 360 degree view of a room and explore literally every ankle of it. This is an example for a strong mutation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Gilt is still a very young company, means we are still learning how to institutionalize innovation in the company, but so far I believe that the 3 pillars of innovation in Gilt are &lt;b&gt;people, process and culture. &lt;/b&gt;You need people that are creative and intelligent. You need a process that is open and transparent. And you need a culture that equally celebrates success and failure.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;In that context we are experimenting with &#34;Unstructured Time&#34; where we bring people together without an agenda. We also believe that a lot of good ideas will not come from us, but from outside the company and in that context we are currently building a public API that we will expose to partners and other interested parties, so that they can innovate independently from us. Earlier this year we did a &lt;a href=&#34;http://money.cnn.com/2011/03/09/technology/hackathons/index.htm&#34;&gt;hackathon&lt;/a&gt; and had the entire SW development organization on the hunt for the next better idea and also prove it (within 24 hours). Our &lt;a href=&#34;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gilt-on-the-go/id331804452?mt=8&#34;&gt;color search feature&lt;/a&gt; (which allows you to take a picture of a color and search for similar products) and the public API were actually incubated in the hackthon. We are also doing a lot of A/B testing to measure the &#34;goodness&#34; of our ideas. This allows us to rationalize the conversation about the value of certain ideas. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;But there is always more to do. Right now, we are thinking about a &#34;follow-the-sun&#34; hackathon were global teams will implement something over a period of three days, because we are suspicious that some good ideas, will get conceived, when people from different cultural backgrounds work together, means it is not only about creativity and intelligence, but also about heterogeneity.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style=&#34;float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px; height: 165px;&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SKu1QBbZHOw/Ts5wRNhbAPI/AAAAAAAAAUQ/n0NNY_QoLzE/s200/Diversity_Matters_photo_without_wording_.jpg&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; id=&#34;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5678599621150703858&#34; /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Let me wrap up, by exploring that thought more. &lt;b&gt;It is my believe that culturally diverse, cultur&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;ally heterogeneous environments are more likely to be innovative than homogeneous environments.&lt;/b&gt; If you also believe in the value of heterogeneity than there is good news, because the Irish software engineering population is among the most heterogeneous and diverse in Europe, maybe even in the world, means Ireland allows you to build teams that will look at problems and possible solutions in different/unique ways. They all went to different schools and had different experiences before they came to Ireland. This creates an environment for innovation to happen.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ireland is the only English speaking country in the Eurozone. This makes it easy for talent to relocate to Ireland and to work here. Building an innovation hub will probably to a certain extend rely on our ability to take advantage of the talent in the rest of Europe and to use the heterogeneity and diversity that comes with it as a driver to build creative, innovative teams here in Ireland.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Gilt is very excited to be in Ireland. We are looking to use our presence here to build a stronger, more scalable, even more innovative Gilt Technologie Organisation.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>This is going to be a short blog post. A Facebook post by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/brikelly&#34;&gt;Brian Kelly&lt;/a&gt; made me revisit the stuff that &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_H._Pink&#34;&gt;Dan Pink&lt;/a&gt; did and is doing.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The main idea behind Drive (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded&#34;&gt;RSA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html&#34;&gt;TED&lt;/a&gt;) is that Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose unleash the creative power of individuals and teams, not material/monetary incentives. Opensource and Wikipedia and ... are obviously the classic/legendary examples for this FACT (and yes, it is a fact :)).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Check it out. It is an Idea Worth Spreading :).&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Skills, Innovation and the future of Ireland - Bermuda Triangle or Trinity</title>

      <description>Ireland (like any other country in the world right now) needs to reinvent itself. The Celtic Tiger (1.0) is over. Question is: What&#39;s next? Do we want a Celtic Tiger 2.0? If so, how should it look like? And how do we make it happen?&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://chrishornat.blogspot.com/2009/01/innovation.html&#34;&gt;Chris Horn&lt;/a&gt; has published a couple of interesting blog entries and articles on the topic.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For me the key is skills and innovation. Skill comes in two flavors: expertise and experience. The Celtic Tiger 1.0 was based on expertise. At the time Ireland was building a very well educated workforce (Trinity College, UCD, University of Limerick, ... ) and was also enjoying (or creating) other (monetary) benefits (like low corporate taxes, low wages, lots of EU aids, ...).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_Tiger&#34;&gt;These times are clearly over&lt;/a&gt; and Ireland has to find a new (the next) niche to compete in the global economy. My hope and my belief is that Ireland can reinvent itself around a different set of skills, namely the experience the workforce has gained in the last 10 years. Right now is the (a good) time to reinvent Ireland as a place, where small startups can flourish and succeed: A European (Software) Business Incubator.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Lets make it happen.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Commercial Open Source for Apache Projects - Survival of the fittest</title>

      <description>Just found &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.freedomoss.com&#34;&gt;another company&lt;/a&gt; offering commercial support for Apache ServiceMix and Apache ActiveMQ (&lt;a href=&#34;http://fusesource.com/&#34;&gt;like we do :)&lt;/a&gt;). For me this is good news. It shows that more and more people use Apache integration projects in mission-critical deployment scenarios. And that these deployments generate enough value for customers to warrant an &#34;insurance&#34; against worst-case scenarios. &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For me it was never the goal to be the only company to offer consulting, training and support for Apache integration projects. My goal was (and will always be) to provide the &#34;best&#34; (read most valuable) consulting, training and support offerings you can get for these projects.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Luckily Progress shares this ambition. This year we will increase the revenue we generate with FUSE (and the budget that comes with it) by roughly 200%. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Statements like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.freedomoss.com/freeesb&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; ...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;With the recent announcement of Progress Software acquiring Iona Technologies, Freedom OSS believes that professional support for Servicemix ESB and Active MQ will be dropped from IONA/Fuse.&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;... can safely be considered FUD.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Open Source Marketing - and what it got to do with the Michelin brothers</title>

      <description>Open Core Licensing and the business model behind it is not (really) new. When you look at it from a history/marketing point of view there are lots of examples, where money is/was made with a &#34;handle-blade&#34; model.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;From a marketing point of view the most famous example is probably Gillette. They give away the handles and make a lot of money with the blades. This works because they have a very strong brand and because they &#34;own&#34; the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.weeklygripe.co.uk/a156.asp&#34;&gt;interface&lt;/a&gt; between the handle and the blade.&#xA;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Open Core Licensing uses some aspects of this idea. It gives way the core (handle) and wants to make money with add-ons (blades), but there are also a couple of very significant differences.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;First, the handle in the Open Core Licensing model has a value on its own. You can use it to shave yourself. It is working. Out of the box. No blade needed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Second, Open Source customers would probably never accept a handle, with a proprietary  &#34;PlugIn-API&#34;, which would force you to buy your blades from &#34;a/the&#34; company that owns that interface.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Means the blade-handle picture is going to get us only so far.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But there are other pictures we might want to take a look at that do not need a &#34;proprietary&#34; interface. In 1850 two brothers were running a rubber factory in Clermont-Ferrand. They were called &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelin&#34;&gt;Eduard and Andre Michelin&lt;/a&gt;. The business was not going well, because producing rubber was getting commoditized, resulting in lots of competition and low margins. But then they had a good idea and a brilliant idea. First they realized that making rubber is not good enough anymore, but that they knew a lot about rubber and they figured that they could become their own customers and build something out of rubber. But what? This is where genius struck the first time: They realized that cars and bicycles would benefit from rubber tyres. The beauty of it is that you sell a blade (tyre) on a handle (car) that will wear-off when you use it. And this is were genius struck a second time. Eduard and Andre concluded that they have to find a way to make people drive and what better reason there is for driving than food or even better good food. As result they decided to put together and publish a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelin_Guide&#34;&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt; on (good) restaurants and give away this guide for free (at least initially). What a brilliant idea!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Again Open Core Licensing uses some aspects of this idea, but not all of them. The main point is that Michelin did not own the interface, means they expected that sooner or later more people will be able to copy-cat their idea and produce tyres. As a result they focuses much more on making the car a success and making people drive, betting on the fact that they had an (first-mover) advantage in the resulting tyre market, because they were the first ones in the market and that they could make more money being &#34;a&#34; player in large market, rather than being &#34;the&#34; (only) player in a small market. To map this to Open Core Licensing we maybe have to think up-side down, means the integration market is the car and we have valuable add-ons (tyres) for this market, that people occasionally buy. How about creating a guide/solution for good integration, that will make people integrate systems? And give it away for free and benefit from the resulting (larger) integration market?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Again this picture is only going to get us so far, but it can at the same time give interesting insights into the dynamics of open source business models.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Open Source Business Models - Open-Core Licensing</title>

      <description>OH NO, please!!! YABOOSBM!!! Yet another blog entry on open-source business models :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, let&#39;s make it as short and as sweet as possible :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning I was reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.the451group.com/opensource/2008/09/01/andrew-lampitt-defines-open-core-licensing/&#34;&gt;Matt Aslett&#39;s comment&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;http://alampitt.typepad.com/lampitt_or_leave_it/2008/08/open-core-licen.html&#34;&gt;Andrew Lampitt&#39;s blog&lt;/a&gt; entry on &#34;Open-Core&#34; licensing (which actually contains a link to a good &lt;a href=&#34;http://stephesblog.blogs.com/presentations/MySQL_OSBC_200705_handout.pdf&#34;&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt; by MySQL chief Marten Mickos).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about the approach is that it tries to take the emotion out of the discussion. We obviously all know in our head that open-source is about free speech and not free beer, but the heart then still reacts (at least sometimes) disappointed, when companies show that they are not pursuing  an open-source strategy for purely philosophical and/or altruistic reasons. In that context some of the hybrid models (e.g. selling closed-source features on top of a open-source core) got a bad reputation and got dismissed as &#34;bait-and-switch&#34; models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The value of open-source is NOT in the absence of a desire to make money with it. This is actually healthy and will make sure the approach/model with survive in the long-run.&#xA;&#xA;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me an interesting value of open-source is that it redefines the customer-vendor relationship. It creates a very open, honest pay-as-you-go relationship. Customers are not forced to give large sums of money to a vendor up-front and trust the vendor that it will do the right things with this money. Open-source is the ultimate customer empowerment tool (within limits as discussed by &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.the451group.com/opensource/2008/08/28/hell-freezes-over-matt-asay-on-the-problem-of-open-source-revenue-models/&#34;&gt;Matt Asay&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very interesting side effect of this is that it allows the CFO to shift money from his capital expense budget to his operational expense budget, which in general makes his business more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are good reasons for open-source. And yes, to keep it alive, we have to find ways to make money with it and share the ROI over the entire delivery/value-chain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortening the list of open-source business models in Marten&#39;s presentation, I right now see the following main models in the market:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open-Core Model - have an open-source core and sell closed-source features on top of it (e.g. SugarCRM)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dual Licensing Model- one product/project that gets licensed with a viral, GPL-style license and a commercial closed-source license (e.g. MySQL)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Services Models - where you get to download a productized version of an open-source project and pay a fee for the support you get on it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;All of these (and variations/combinations of these) are good valid models, which can deliver a lot of value to customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It remains to be seen, which one will proof to be the most innovative one.</description>

      <title>Randy Pausch - about elephants, walls, rooms and TVs</title>
      <link>http://tedn.life/2008/08/04/randy-pausch-about-elephants-walls-rooms-and-tvs/</link>

      <description>Last week &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Pausch&#34;&gt;Randy Pausch&lt;/a&gt; died. With all the hype around his cancer and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo&#34;&gt;&#34;the last lecture&#34;&lt;/a&gt;, it was/is kind of hard to see who he was or what he was. Yesterday I tried to find out a little bit &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.virginia.edu/%7Erobins/Randy/&#34;&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5784740380335567758&#34;&gt;watched&lt;/a&gt; his &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.virginia.edu/%7Erobins/Randy/RandyPauschTimeManagement2007.pdf&#34;&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt; on time management. Good presentation, but not something that we haven&#39;t heard before. In the end I have to agree with him: He is a smart professor, but there are lots of smart professors out there. What made him unique was not what he did, but why he did it and how he did it. From what I saw of him, he had a passionate ambition to make learning fun. His students were his customers and he felt an obligation to deliver value to them. He found his purpose and lived it. And &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: bold;&#34;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; makes him a role model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my personal take-aways ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;if there is an elephant in the room ... then talk about it!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#34;experience is what you get, when you don&#39;t get what you want&#34;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;walls are there to show you how much you really want something&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;if your children want to paint their room ... let them do it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;switch off the godd.... television&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;In this blog I am not talking about how he dealt with his cancer, because I believe that this is not something he wants to be remembered for.</description>

      <title>Innovation on Innovation - How to make elephants dance</title>

      <description>Yesterday I went out and had a pint with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linkedin.com/in/saileshpanchal&#34;&gt;Sailesh Panchal&lt;/a&gt;. He is an Enterprise Architect with the payments division of Lloyds TSB in London. Part of his responsibility is to foster innovation in Lloyds.&#xA;&#xA;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Obviously innovation needs to be directed towards a measurable goal/target/impact for the customer and/or the company. To judge, if an/the idea was just a good idea or a real innovation, you must be able to show some measurable ROI in a defined timeframe. Depending on the &#34;size&#34; of the innovation and the size of the organizations these timeframes can be easily 6 month or more. That&#39;s a long way down the road.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Question is: What kind of signposts can you create to judge ideas earlier?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We are looking for innovative ideas to foster, measure and rank (by value and relevance) innovative ideas in large enterprises. Sailesh is currently contemplating about implementing a system/culture, where the value of ideas gets rated by the number of citations that are made, means if you and your idea gets cited a lot the likelyhood that it is a good idea is high(er).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Just wondering ... communities.iona.com is implemented with Jive. We have a ranking for the number of posts a given individual creates. But there are markups that you can use to reference other docs and threads. Just wondering, if it would be possible to have a ranking for the docs and threads that get referenced the most?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Just wondering ... &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>The Colossus of Rhodes</title>

      <description>Now. Lets get things started. Lets talk about innovation.&#xA;&#xA;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;for a well-known reason (at least) once a year i am in greece. this year we also went to rhodos to see the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_of_Rhodes&#34;&gt;colossus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;question is: was this innovation? i mean, is it innovative to come up with the idea to build something like the colossus?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;what is the nature of innovation? how is it for instance different from creativity?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;there are obviously lots of websites that offer a definition of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity&#34;&gt;creativity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation&#34;&gt;innovation. &lt;/a&gt;there are also attempts to define the &lt;a href=&#34;http://innovateonpurpose.blogspot.com/2006/05/creativity-versus-innovation.html&#34;&gt;difference between creativity and innovation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;fortunately i had one of my most trusted advisors with me and the conclusion of the discussion is, that creativity is about ideas and innovation is about results. Creativity is the at the core of innovation, but not every creative idea is also actually innovative, because innovation always serves a purpose. Innovation is directed towards a goal. It strives to improve a situation in a given context.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&#34;Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things.&#34; Theodore Levitt (Havard Buisness School)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;i think the colussus was a creative idea, but have him hold up the fire to find the harbour was innovative.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;next: is the iphone creative or innovative?&lt;/div&gt;</description>
