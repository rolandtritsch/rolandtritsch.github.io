title: Discussing Remote ... the book!!!
---
I am just done with Remote ...

* agree with some of it, but ... not with all of it
* there are some bad arguments
* remote-first is not the solution when your office is filled with interruptions and distractions and when your are a procrastinator that has OCD
* let's make it a solution for the right problem
* you want to hire great people/enginners and ... they know how to be successful
* at home individuals are more successful/productive. In the office teams are more successful/productive. In the office you have to work hard(er) to make individuals productive. At home you have to work harder to make team productive.
* why remote? For orgs up to 200 people. The nature of distribution. Dunbar Number (100). ??? Distance/Number (100 meters). Software looks like org. Remote first means 80% not in the office as oppose to hub-first with support for working remote/from home (20% of people/20% of the time; which is difficult in a different way (because it is hard to develop the right behaviors/processes/tools(profiency). Good reasons for remote. Beat the traffic. Hire everywhere(kind of). Timezone coverage. Bad reasons for remote. Safe money. Hire everywhere. Avoid distractions. Compete with large(r) tech organizations. Doing flexible work hours (because you can do that from an office; if you want)
