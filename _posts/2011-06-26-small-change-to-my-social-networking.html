First of all ... apologies!!! In the last 2 weeks my (private) tweeds (almost) completely died away. I was just madly busy with work :(. <div><br /></div><div>Going forward, I will (continue to) send my "diary" updates to @rolandtritsch, but will send my more work related tweeds (e.g. Blogging about ..., Reading about ..., Looking at ...) to @innolocity. @innolocity is a public feed. Just register <a href="http://twitter.com/innolocity">here</a> to follow. </div>
