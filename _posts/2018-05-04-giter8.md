title: Tenable new hire training ... and integrating sbt-release with sbt-github-release
---
The other day I was flying to the [Tenable](https://www.tenable.com) new hire training [in Columbia/MD](http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-tenable-columbia-20171117-story.html) and that means ... 8 hours of uninterrupted coding time!!!

At the same time, I saw/found the [sbt-guthub-release plugin](https://github.com/ohnosequences/sbt-github-release) and started to wonder, if it would be possible to combine it with the [sbt-release plugin](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-release).

And while I was thinking about this I figured "what the hell", why not creating another **opinionated** giter8 template to bootstrap my scala projects, means at the end I decided to spend the 8 hours on bringing a couple of things together ...

* a [giter8](https://github.com/foundweekends/giter8) template to generate a scala projects, that ...
* uses [sbt-release](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-release) for the release process and the versioning ...
* uses [sbt-github-release](https://github.com/ohnosequences/sbt-github-release) to upload the release artifacts to github (including release notes) ...
* uses [sbt-ensime](https://github.com/ensime/ensime-sbt) to generate the `.ensime` file (to make [Emacs/Ensime](http://ensime.github.io/) work)
* has some minimal documentation (to give `sbt doc` something to do)
* uses [neo-sbt-scalafmt](https://github.com/lucidsoftware/neo-sbt-scalafmt) to allow you to (re)format the source code
* uses [scala-logging](https://github.com/lightbend/scala-logging)
* is configured to support [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org/), [ScalaCheck](https://www.scalacheck.org) and [ScalaMeter](https://scalameter.github.io)

The idea was to provide a **fat** template and allow people to delete what they do not want/need.

And at the end I had [a very rewarding flight](https://github.com/rolandtritsch/scala.g8) :).
