title: Complex Event Processing - An exiting (new) frontier
---

Through the merger (:)) with Progress, I got exposed to the new exciting field of (Real-Time) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_Event_Processing">Complex Event Processing</a> (CEP). There are a couple of obvious use cases in finance (e.g. algorithmic stock trading) and manufacturing (e.g.  detecting possible problems in the assembly line, which might effect your just-in-time service-level-agreements).<div><br /></div><div>Complex Event Processing or Intelligent Event Correlation is not what excites me. That was/is also possible using large data-warehouses and suitable data-mining solutions, but then you learn about it after the fact. It is not so much Complex Event Processing, it is more Complex Event Analysis. </div><div><br /></div><div>What excites me is the real-time aspect. The possibility to re-act to a set of correlated events as they happen.</div><div><br /></div><div>The longer I think about it the more use-cases I see. Last month a large (if not the largest) utility provider world-wide visited us in Dublin for a 4-day SOA workshop. Among other things, they are looking for a solution to detect failures in the power grid before they happen or narrow down the location of the failure (faulty transformer) after it happens (e.g. to get a repair team onsite faster).</div><div><br /></div><div>Last night I found a talk on Google Talks describing a solution for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PiMimSrP7A">Device-free Passive Localization for Wireless Environments</a>. Another interesting use-case.</div><div><br /></div><div>CEP is everywhere. I am dying to find out, what the value of a solution for this kind of problems is.</div>
