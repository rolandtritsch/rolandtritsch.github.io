      <description>This blog post is interesting in more than one way, because &amp;hellip;
I am going to discuss a topic that is deer to my heart: What do we need to do to get to a better place with respect to a sustainable energy future? And I am going to use a new approach: Where I am first going to articulate my thoughts and then I am going to complement it with a fireside chat that I had with chatGPT about the topics at hand.</description>

      <description>6 years ago I wrote a blog post to express that my wife loves me for a lot of different reasons and that there is no reason to be surprised about the climate change that we are experiencing.
Note: If you do not know, why there is a picture of a microwave here, you need to read the first blog post.
I am compelled to write about it again.
Mainly because it did not get better.</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip; is the laptop? No (but more on this later)!
&amp;hellip; is the mobile phone (with good 4G coverage)? No (and again &amp;hellip; more on this later)!
&amp;hellip; is a foldable coffee mug!!!
When you start to work remote (from home, from any place, &amp;hellip;) you will discover that you will end up in coffee shops (either because you want to (because you want/need to fight the cabin fever) or because you have to (because you want/need to find/have a WLAN connection)).</description>

      <description>I am driving an electric car. It is a great experience. Not to a small part, because the Irish government is trying very hard to make it a good experience. Government grants, good infrastructure, friendly people.
The other day, I noticed something that leaves room for improvement. On a Sunday afternoon, I was charging my car at the quick charger at the LUAS station in Stillorgan. The parking lot is operated by NCPS and has signs on the ground and on sign-posts to indicate that the spaces are reserved for electric vehicle (EV) charging.</description>

      <title>Why are we surprised? - &#34;Hot, hot, hot&#34;</title>

      <description>Christina loves me. For a lot of reasons. One of them is that I have this habit of putting stuff into the microwave, heat it for 10 mins (I am exhaturating) and then try to take it out with my bare hands, while shouting (with this expression of total surprise on my face) &amp;ldquo;hot, hot, hot&amp;rdquo;.
Why am I surprised? If you put stuff into the microwave (longer than 30 secs) it is probably going to be (very) hot, right?</description>

      <description>In case you are wondering ... this is the BADMobile ... (ask me, if you want :)) ...
My friend Klaus and myself have spend more time and more miles (on motorbike(s)) together than we care to count. And the pattern is that once in a while we need to do something crazy. This time around we decided that in the next 5 years we will visit all of the major road races in the UK &amp;amp; Ireland (at least) once.</description>

      <description>A year ago I had a couple of pints with Dan Salt (Chief Software Architect at GE Energy) and we discussed the current state of affairs with respect to IT and Software Architectures/Solutions in the Energy/Utility sector. As a result I started to develop an interest in Smart Meter (just watch the first 5 min), Smart Grid, Micro Grid and Grid 2.0 concepts/solutions.
Here is a summary of the problems as I see them .</description>
