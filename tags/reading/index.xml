      <description>I am reading it again: Clean Code.
This time I am reading it differently. The first time around (6 years ago), I was reading it and learned a lot (about how to write clean code) and was using it (a lot) to get other people on board and convince them that this is the way (the only way) to write code.
I still think that the book can serve that purpose.</description>
