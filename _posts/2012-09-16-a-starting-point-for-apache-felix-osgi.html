It is not a secret ...<br /><br />I like <a href="http://blog.tritsch.org/2010/04/managing-complexity-with-osgi-in-and.html" target="_blank">OSGi</a> and Scala ... and therefore it was only a question of time until I started to wonder, if there is anything that would prevent me from using OSGi from/with Scala. The short answer and the good news is ... nothing.<br /><br />I just <a href="https://github.com/rolandtritsch/apache-felix-scala-tutorial" target="_blank">checked in</a> my port of the original <a href="http://felix.apache.org/site/apache-felix-osgi-tutorial.html" target="_blank">Apache Felix Tutorial</a> to Scala. As mentioned in the README I do not want to claim that this boilerplate code, but it is a working development environment that you can use as a starting point for your own experiments.
