      <title>Discussing Remote ... the book!!!</title>

      <description>These days people look for advice and insight into how to build and run a remote-first engineering organization. And want/need to learn fast!!!
One good resource is (obviously) Remote (kind of the bible on working remote).
The book was published in 2013 (and was probably written in the 12 month before that).
Obviously the key messages/statements from the book are still true (or truer than ever), but I think that since then things have also changed and evolved.</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip; is the laptop? No (but more on this later)!
&amp;hellip; is the mobile phone (with good 4G coverage)? No (and again &amp;hellip; more on this later)!
&amp;hellip; is a foldable coffee mug!!!
 When you start to work remote (from home, from any place, &amp;hellip;) you will discover that you will end up in coffee shops (either because you want to (because you want/need to fight the cabin fever) or because you have to (because you want/need to find/have a WLAN connection)).</description>

      <description>Builder and runner of functional teams and functional systems
  Explorer of extreme digital nomading and remote-first cultures
 My name is Roland Tritsch. I am a Software Engineer. I am a Manager. I am a Husband and a Father. I like to make engineers grow and users smile. I like computer science. I believe that computers and software can help to make this planet a better place. When I am not building, running or fixing something (preferably using a functional programming language like Haskell or Scala), I am on a hike (somewhere).</description>

      <description>In the last 25 years I have build and run multiple distributed software engineering organisations.
My management style/philosophy is based on a couple of core believes &amp;hellip;
 The Power of Why - I like to lead with Why (to make sure Talent and Passion can meet a Purpose) People first - I always think and feel that people are the solution (not the problem) Heterogenerity for the win - You have to be different to complement each other (and to create innovation) No surprises - Everybody (at all times) should be clear on what is happening and why it is happening, which leads to &amp;hellip; Building and maintain trust (and respect) (between the people) at all cost!</description>

      <description>The corona virus has a lot of weird side effects.
You suddenly find time to do things that you couldn&amp;rsquo;t do (or wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do) for month!!!
In my case I just updated/refreshed my blogging infrastructure &amp;hellip;
 switching from jekyll to hugo (more capable framework; good support for Emacs org-mode) adding support for tags and categories retiring www.tritsch.org and www.innolocity.org (replacing it with tedn.life (more on that in due course))  The result is aesthetically pleasing.</description>

      <guid>http://tedn.life/2019/04/06/i-love-haskell/</guid>
      <description>Over the last 2 years I did a fair bit of Haskell (after doing a fairer bit of Scala for 8 years).
And I love Haskell.
Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong: If you are tied to the JVM eco-system (and who is not these days), my opinion is that Scala is your best option to do functional programming on the JVM.
At the same time writting code in Haskell feels very natural to me.</description>

      <title>Hub-First vs. Remote-First vs. Pod-First ... Skating to where the puck is going to be</title>

      <description>Fig 1: Skating to where the puck ...  Finding good and the right talent for an engineering organisation is as challenging as ever.
And then you need to keep engagement high and attrition low and you need to build/deliver something (with good/high velocity/efficiency/quality).
One key component to get this right is a good/the right structure for your engineering organisation.
And you probably want to structure it in a way so that it not only works today, but also in 2-3 years from now, because otherwise by the time you are done building the org it will not work (anymore)).</description>

      <title>Advent of Code ... Final cut (... and First cut :))</title>

      <description>Today Advent of Code 2018 started again (at 05:00am (GMT))!!!
And &amp;hellip;
&amp;hellip; just in time &amp;hellip;
&amp;hellip; today I am also wrapping up Advent of Code 2017!!!
My first implementation was (obviously) in Scala.
And that one alone was interesting, because I also used ScalaCheck for property-based testing and ScalaMeter to implement performance tests for all solutions.
I then made the Scala code cross-compile with ScalaNative.
At the time I was also learning Kotlin and spend some cycles to port the code to Kotlin.</description>

      <description>Last year I spend some time and money to &amp;ldquo;renovate&amp;rdquo; my old 17-inch Macbook Pro (remember the good old times &amp;hellip; when Apple was building good laptops with great keyboards and no touchbar :)).
For the last 6 month I was running VirtualBox on it hosting an Ubuntu image.
That kind of worked (a little bit slow at times and managing the ports was (sometimes) challenging, but otherwise &amp;hellip; ok).</description>

      <description>Not sure if this has ever happen to you, &amp;hellip;
&amp;hellip; but once a month I am sitting in a hotel lobby or a coffee shop and I cannot (for the life of it) make Chrome show me the login screen to the Wifi portal and then you start to fiddle around with stop/start the Wifi and/or disconnect/connect to the Wifi and/or start a different browser (e.g. Firefox or Safari) and/or try a private browser window and/or clear the DNS cache and/or &amp;hellip; reboot!</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the Advent of Code &amp;hellip; again!!!
Last time we talked about a/the Scala implementation.
This time around I figured that I need to understand what the hype about Kotlin is all about and decided to port my Scala solutions to Kotlin.
There is a separate blog post on what I think about Kotlin, but overall it was a positive experience. I like Kotlin (but would not suggest/recommend it as a replacement for Scala).</description>

      <title>Kotlin ... the better Java?</title>

      <guid>http://tedn.life/2018/08/11/kotlin-...-the-better-java/</guid>
      <description>Everybody is talking about Kotlin. Me too!!!
Obviously the question is: Is Kotlin the next better thing?
Is Kotlin going to replace Java? Is Kotlin going to replace Scala? Is Kotlin the next better language that will make Software Engineers (much) more productive?
To find out I ported my Scala Advent of Code solutions to Kotlin.
My main take aways are &amp;hellip;
 if you know Java, learning Kotlin will be easier and faster than learning Scala Kotlin is without a doubt &amp;ldquo;the better Java&amp;rdquo;  it compiles fast it runs fast it has very good tooling/IDE support (namely (obviously) the support in Intellij is first-class) it runs on Android hell &amp;hellip; it even runs on Raspberry Pi with Arrows it has a very nice (pure) functional programming library   if you know Scala, learning Kotlin will be even easier, but you will also feel that you are not gaining anything or even that you are loosing some capabilities that are valuable  Sooooo &amp;hellip; my exec summary is &amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>Learn you a ... Haskell!</title>

      <guid>http://tedn.life/2018/08/11/learn-you-a-...-haskell/</guid>
      <description>In the last 6 month I have started to wonder.
First of all &amp;hellip; I am convinced that using the concepts of functional programming will give you better results (more maintainable/changeable/extendable code). Not embracing functional programming will (sooner or later) put you (and the organisation you are leading) at a competitive disadvantage (compared to those who do).
In that context I have put some time into learning more Scala (the learning never stops :)) and have also looked at Kotlin.</description>

      <description>The other day I was explaining again how to build an MVP and I was using the skateboard picture (again :)).
In the middle of the discussion I realized that we only had half of the discussion, because we only talked about the direct benefits of the approach: Fast feedback, less risk to build the wrong thing, &amp;hellip;
We did not really talk about the cost of getting these benefits. The meeting got interesting when I started to point out that this is not about building the solution the fastest way or the cheapest way.</description>

      <description>OK &amp;hellip; it took me a while, but &amp;hellip; hopefully it was worth it!!!
Last year at christmas I did the Advent of Code and &amp;hellip; really liked it!!!
If you do not know it, it is a series (25 of them) of code puzzles that need to be solved to unlock a/the christmas tree (every day (between Dec. 1st and Dec. 25th) a new/the next puzzle becomes available).
The puzzles do a lot of different things and will test your ability to come up with good/clever datastructures/algorithms.</description>

      <description>The other day I was flying to the Tenable new hire training in Columbia/MD and that means &amp;hellip; 8 hours of uninterrupted coding time!!!

At the same time, I saw/found the sbt-guthub-release plugin and started to wonder, if it would be possible to combine it with the sbt-release plugin.
And while I was thinking about this I figured &amp;ldquo;what the hell&amp;rdquo;, why not creating another opinionated giter8 template to bootstrap my scala projects, means at the end I decided to spend the 8 hours on bringing a couple of things together &amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Back to the roots!!!
I am writing Gatling tests (again :)). (Obviously) I used to do this (a lot :)), when I was with Gilt (for an obvious reason :)).
To get going again, I had to make the basics work &amp;hellip; again.
The basics are: Make the sbt-gatling plugin work to build (end-to-end integration) tests/simulations and then create a &amp;ldquo;deployable&amp;rdquo; (fat) jar (using sbt-assembly).
This proved to be more difficult than I thought (because this used to work).</description>

And right now &amp;hellip; Digital Transformation is a very hot topic. For most of the Fortune 500 companies! And it is also a very complex topic (e.g. How to make sure that (PDF) documents can become a first class citizen in the Digital Transformation initiative).
Companies obviously want it. Either to gain a competitive advantage or at least to not put themselves at a competitive disadvantage.</description>

      <description>A lot has been written and said about what you need to do as a manager or more specifically as a manager of a software development team/group/organisation.
You need to understand people and the business and technology (software engineering processes and practices, tools and frameworks, programming languages, &amp;hellip;).
You need to be a manager and a leader. You need to be a friend and a dad (or mother) and a boss.</description>

Not in the sense that I want/need to build cars, but in the sense that Henry Ford famously once upon a time (apparently not) said, that if he would have build what customers wanted, he would have build faster horses.
Luckily he was able to complement the input from the customers (we want faster horses) with a view of what is possible (cars).</description>

      <description>The other day I was reading the letter that Jeff Bezo&amp;rsquo;s is writing to shareholders every year.
The obsession with fast, good decision making was and is resonating with me.
I like fast decision making processes that produce good decisions. And I like cultures and behaviors that foster environments that produce these fast, good decisions.
In the case of Amazon they have developed a set of leadership principles and behaviors (like the famous 2 pizza rule) to protect their agility and velocity, while they are scaling (and to make sure they stay a Day 1 company).</description>

      <description>In the week of Jul., 10th we are going to do our next Hackweek.
The concept is not new. A lot of companies do it.
The question is: Why is it valuable?
For me the answer is: Because you want to make sure you are not building faster horses!
Henry Ford once famously said (or not said :)): &amp;ldquo;If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.</description>

      <description>I am reading it again: Clean Code.
This time I am reading it differently. The first time around (6 years ago), I was reading it and learned a lot (about how to write clean code) and was using it (a lot) to get other people on board and convince them that this is the way (the only way) to write code.
I still think that the book can serve that purpose.</description>

      <description>Sometimes for me discussions about Operational Excellence sound like discussions about teenager sex: Everybody is talking about it, nobody &amp;hellip;
The other day I was wondering again: What is Operational Excellence and why should you have it?
For me Operational Excellence is the ability of an organization to make (initially small and then over time bigger and bigger) promises and keep them consistently and reliably within budget (time and money).</description>

      <description>I am driving an electric car. It is a great experience. Not to a small part, because the Irish government is trying very hard to make it a good experience. Government grants, good infrastructure, friendly people.
The other day, I noticed something that leaves room for improvement. On a Sunday afternoon, I was charging my car at the quick charger at the LUAS station in Stillorgan. The parking lot is operated by NCPS and has signs on the ground and on sign-posts to indicate that the spaces are reserved for electric vehicle (EV) charging.</description>

      <description>Architecting and designing large (distributed) systems makes you think about complexity. A lot!!!
The first question that you want to ask yourself is probably &amp;ldquo;What is complexity?&amp;quot;.
For that I recommend to watch Rich Hickey&amp;rsquo;s talk on complexity (Simple Made Easy). In this talk he raises awareness for the difference between something being complex or complicated. And he also (rightfully) points out that simple is actually very hard (every idiot can build a complicated solution) and that simple is a relative term (something that is simple for you can look complex and/or complicated to others).</description>

      <description>Finding a good and maybe even the right org structure for an engineering organization is something of a dark art.
Initially everything is so easy. 5-10 engineers are in one location, have one boss, work on the one thing and have one common skill.
But then you are successful. And you hire more engineers and then you realize that to derisk the hiring and the growth you probably want to hire in more than one location and then a couple of engineers will leave, because the people management aspect of the being an engineering manager is not something that comes naturally to most of us.</description>

My social media setup was to post to Google+ and then use twitterfeed to cross-post to twitter and facebook.
With twitterfeed going out of business I am &amp;hellip;
 &amp;hellip; going to retire my Google+ account &amp;hellip; going to use HootSuite to selectively post to twitter (business, technical, work) and facebook (private, personal) &amp;hellip; going to continue to use Flickr to publish pictures &amp;hellip; going to continue to use GitHub to host my blog (and will cross-post on medium and linked-in for visibility).</description>

The other day a colleague of mine pointed me to the new website/book from Jim Carrey &amp;ldquo;How Roland rolls&amp;rdquo; and while looking at it I started to think about my name: What does it mean? What is the origin? What are other well-known usages?
Here is what I found out &amp;hellip;
 Roland was a knight who fought for Charles the Great (also called the father of Europe).</description>

      <description>Clearly &amp;hellip; and obviously &amp;hellip; the idea of Software Gardening is not mine. But as I have already mentioned once or twice &amp;hellip; I like it a lot.
And it is also something that we have adopted here at Nitro Engineering as a guiding principle for our daily actions and daily habits.
In general software architecture is something that you cannot see or touch, but in October I had the engineering managers in Dublin and that chance was just too good to not use it, means we all hoped on a bus and went to see the real thing!</description>

      <description>Yesterday I had a good day in the office!
Nitro (like a lot of other startups) is going through growing pains. In the last 2 years we have hired a lot of people (and have not been able to retain all of them). We have build a lot of systems, platforms, features and products (and some of it turned into technical debt faster than we wanted). We implemented processes and practices (and not all of them made us more productive or faster).</description>

Why are we talking about this &amp;hellip;

I smell opportunity! Opportunity to do something that I always wanted to do: Explore the bay area on a motor bike.
The Nitro CEO was kind enough to introduce me to Wolfgang and Wolfgang and his team helped me to get my hands on a BMW R1200 RT and off we go.
Motorcycling in San Francisco (SF) can be tricky.</description>

      <description>Christina loves me. For a lot of reasons. One of them is that I have this habit of putting stuff into the microwave, heat it for 10 mins (I am exhaturating) and then try to take it out with my bare hands, while shouting (with this expression of total surprise on my face) &amp;ldquo;hot, hot, hot&amp;rdquo;.
Why am I surprised? If you put stuff into the microwave (longer than 30 secs) it is probably going to be (very) hot, right?</description>

In reverse order, first: (Given that I am a VP Infrastructure Engineering) I am currently in the process to refactor my personal infrastructure and I am consolidate most of it on GitHub and Amazon. The result is the wonderful new website you are looking at. The pages are on GitHub (pages based on Jekyll) and the domains and the DNS are hosted on Amazon.</description>

      <description>Beginning of the year we had one of our Microsoft Senior Architects from the GDC (Global Delivery Center) in India with us. Over a couple of pints the obvious happened: I sparked his interest in functional programming and he sparked my interest in F#.
First I made Mono&amp;nbsp;and Emacs work, but then I started to use Xamarin.
Not so much, because I needed a better IDE (Emacs rules :)), but because I got interested in the claim that you can use Xamarin to do Android and iOS cross-platform development with #F.</description>

      <description>Besides getting my first companion app done for my Pebble, I also spend some time on X-Mas to start porting the Android UI samples to Scala. The samples obviously use gradle. I normally use sbt to build my apps, but this time I decided to stick with gradle, because I wanted to make it easy for people to consume the code (and embracing a new build system might be too big of a step as a first step).</description>

      <description>It is not a secret ... I like Source Code Pro!
A couple of weeks ago I got myself a new MacBook Air (and resisted the temptation to get the 13-inch and like the 11-inch a lot) and installed Source Code Pro again. Getting it installed using FontBook was no problem, but then I could not remember how make it the default font for Emacs and all the tips and tricks that I was able to find did not work for me.</description>

      <description>... everything is better with bluetooth :).
Originally I was thinking to do a presentation, but Martin convinced me to turn my talk for the Scala Meetup in Dublin into a hands-on tutorial.
The main objective was to talk people through a couple of demos that can serve as starting points, so that they can start to do their own development.
We talked about, how to write, compile and run .</description>

      <description>Update 2004-04-02: The first nightlies for M4 got released on CyanogenMod. Testing now ...
---
The short answer is: NO!
At least not in my case (anymore). I just removed all (common) Sense from my phone. HTC Sense that is!

3 month ago I got myself a new phone and decided to go with the HTC One Mini. It is my kind of phone. It runs Android (means I can write Scala apps for it), it is sturdy, looks good and is not too big.</description>

      <description>... just kidding :).
Reality is ... triggered by the release of the Pebble SDK 2.0 on Feb., 3rd (iOS only, more on this later) and after more than 20 years of JVM based software development I willingful decided to write some C code again!!!

And I liked it. Mainly because of CloudPebble. As pointed out here, setting up a software development environment can be a daunting task. Not so with CloudPebble.</description>

      <description>I don&#39;t know what your experience is, but ...
... in my case, when I look at a new technology, one of the main (or first) hurdles is, that it takes some time to get the initial development environment up and running.
This is why I figured it probably makes sense to polish and publish something that I did a couple of month ago: Porting the basic Android tutorial to Scala.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago I got myself an Acer Chromebook and so far I am very happy with it. I use it as a tablet with a keyboard and carry it around with me a lot, but ...
... sometimes I have an hour to kill in a coffee shop and would like to do some software development (in my case and these days mainly Scala) and started to wonder, if and how this is possible.</description>

      <description>I am just back from presenting a talk at FutureStack in SFO.

Very interesting trip. Got very positive feedback on what we are doing. Did meet a lot of people with very interesting ideas (e.g. my friend Klaus (see below)). Lew&#39;s keynote on Rubicon was insightful and inspiring. Kate was talking on the art of self-management and Peter talked about how to run hundreds of Postgres databases for Heroku.</description>

      <description>It is Sunday, the sun is shining ... in Ireland!!! What do you do? Right: You get your laptop and finally start to get your head around the actor model in Scala.
In my case I tried to come up with a simulation for the Dining Philosophers Problem (DPP). There are implementations available, but I consolidated them and renamed the states and transitions to make it more obvious what is going on and used plantUML to come up with State Transition Diagrams (STDs) that show what is going on.</description>

      <description>Psssttt ... don&#39;t tell anybody, but ... at Gilt it is not always about work and writing great code.
Sometimes we like to party. Especially when something like FlightFest comes along and the office is located right down by the Liffey overlooking the river and the Samuel Beckett Bridge.
Sometimes it is too good not to do it. What a great day. For the kids. For the girls and the boys.</description>

      <description>From an interview with Steve. Too good not to turn it into a blog post ...
&#34;When people talk about innovation they are often talking about the solution to some problem. But the real source of innovation is figuring out what the right problem is to solve. Take Gilt for example: Gilt took the invite only friends &amp;amp; family sample sale invite that existed for coveted brands in cities like New York and moved that model online.</description>

      <description>We all have a lot to do. Effective time/task management is essential. I’ve been using GTD (Getting Things Done) for a while now (a long while :)) and for me it comes down to the question, “How do you pick the next, best, most valuable thing to work on?”—basically answering the question of how to make the best use of the time you have.
Picking something from your list of urgent things to do is kind of easy, but how can you make sure you are not missing the opportunity/chance to work on something important, if you get the chance to do so?</description>

      <description>In the last couple of weeks I was working on an initiative to make all the Gilt Tech KPIs available in one place. There are lots of dashboard solutions available, but nothing really did what we wanted it to do or it was clumsy to use. At the end we decided to build a small Scala Play app to get what we want.
As part of that exercise we had to find a way to visualise the history of the KPI values (timestamp, value pairs) and I started to play around with charting frameworks and figured it makes sense to write up what I have found out.</description>

      <description>These days I am writing more source code again (mostly Scala) and decided to (re)read a couple of books to refresh some thoughts and ideas and believes that I always had when it comes to writing source code.
One of the books I was (re)reading was Clean Code and there are lots of good ideas in it, e.g. after reading the book 15 years ago I got into the habit of refactoring, whenever I feel the urge to put a comment in the code, which is an indication that the code is not clear/self-documenting enough.</description>

      <description>&amp;lt;outing alarm&amp;gt;I love my emacs.&amp;lt;/outing alarm&amp;gt;
Sometimes small things can make a big difference. Like a dot. You can put it at the end of the sentence or in a number (1.001 vs. 100.1 - can make a &#34;small&#34; difference) or you put it into the zero to make it easily&amp;nbsp;distinguishable from capital O.
Now you might say, who cares, but if you read a lot of source code (like I do) Source Code Pro&amp;nbsp;is a real pleasure for your eyes.</description>

      <description>20 years ago I used to teach object-oriented programming (based on Eiffel) at my old university in Germany.
This week I got the chance to experience a deja-vu, because earlier this year I did run into Glenn Strong who is teaching Functional Programming in TCD in Dublin and we started to develop the idea that it would be useful to add a Scala module to his Haskell based lecture.</description>

      <description>It is not a secret ...
I like OSGi and Scala ... and therefore it was only a question of time until I started to wonder, if there is anything that would prevent me from using OSGi from/with Scala. The short answer and the good news is ... nothing.
I just checked in my port of the original Apache Felix Tutorial to Scala. As mentioned in the README I do not want to claim that this boilerplate code, but it is a working development environment that you can use as a starting point for your own experiments.</description>

Our requirements are extremely complex and challenging. We have over 5 million members (fast growing) and a product catalog which features products that are selling out between 10 secs and 3 days, means we need to make recommendations for products that have (almost) no history to members that might not be with us for a long time (yet).</description>

The objective was to share a couple of thoughts on what innovation is (or is not), what Gilt is doing to foster innovation and what Ireland has to offer to companies like Gilt.</description>

But most of the more &#34;common&#34; users (and for the sake of the discussion, I am including myself in that group) probably think that cloud computing and using &#34;the cloud&#34; is something that enterprises use to (potentially) safe cost and also to (potentially) gain flexibility.</description>

The main idea behind Drive (RSA, TED) is that Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose unleash the creative power of individuals and teams, not material/monetary incentives. Opensource and Wikipedia and ... are obviously the classic/legendary examples for this FACT (and yes, it is a fact :)).</description>

      <description>Right now the Brandvis SelectPortal system is based on Microsoft .NET and we constantly improve it and add features. While we do this we also constantly refactor the system to eliminate complexity to make it easier to maintain/extend.Triggered by this work and triggered by a talk on reuse of OSGi bundles that I attended a couple of years ago, I started to think about complexity again. The main conclusion of that thought process is that there is probably an optimal (means minimal) complexity for any given system.</description>

      <description>As most of you know, I am married to a greek woman and life in Ireland. Therefore the current economic crisis is omnipresent in my life.
A couple of weeks ago Chris Horn posted an interesting article about certain economical key indicators and what they mean for Ireland. I also saw a good article in the NYT about why and how the US and Ireland and Greece are different (from a financial crises/debt point of view).</description>

At the same there are also examples of very clever and thought-through UI design/implementation. One example in this category is the website for the movie &#34;</description>

      <description>20 years ago I started my career as a Technical Project Manager/Lead Architect for EDS and was working on Bill-of-Material solutions for the Automotive Industry (e.g. Opel).
During my self-declared summer-sabbatical, I was musing over what I want to do next and felt that (if possible) I would like to work again in a business domain and (if possible) maybe (again) in manufacturing.
I am happy to report that it worked out just fine!</description>

      <description>A year ago I developed a small set of demos to show how toaccess SOAP services from the iPhone. To do this I used a very interesting feature of Apache CXF: The ability to generate a complete JavaScript client-side SOAP-stack on the fly.

I just finished an update/upgrade of this demo to show that it also works with the Android Phone. I also ported it to maven, means installing, building and running the demo is much easier now.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I was stumbling over a Facebook status update from Oisin Hurley ...
Oisin Hurley is starting to get a bit irritated with people that unselectively duplicate their twitter stream to their Facebook status. They&#39;re different interactions, people.
This is an interesting observation and creates a bigger question: where do we go with this social-networking, micro-blogging, status-update thingy? 
Initially it was easy: there was just/only twitter and this was the place to do micro-blogging and status-updates, but by now all social-networking sites (Facebook, Linked-In, XING, Plaxo, Bebo, .</description>

      <description>It happened again!!! Another HD crash. A year ago I lost my original 160GB drive and replaced it with a 250GB drive. Now this one failed only 12 month later. I am not sure what is happening here, but I do not feel that I &#34;mishandle&#34; my MacBook in a way that would explain this rate of failure. Let me know, what your experience is. Are MacBooks DiskEaters?</description>

The conference was very well organized (thanks Giovanni) and took place in the beautiful city of Oxford.

      <description>A month ago I decided to use some of my time during the summer and work my way through the pile of books that I always wanted to read and never really got to. The first four weeks proofed to be interesting, very interesting.
I started with &#34;ICon: The Greatest Second Act in the History of Business&#34;. It is obviously a biography about Steve Jobs, but it is also a good book on the history of Apple, the Silicon Valley, Next, Disney and Pixar.</description>

As a result I started to develop an interest in Smart Meter (just watch the first 5 min), Smart Grid, Micro Grid and Grid 2.0 concepts/solutions.

      <description>The Distributed OSGi spec (RFC 119) is coming along nicely, means now might be a good time to raise the head and start to think about what might come next. A couple of month ago David, Roman and myself got together and concluded to set up a research project on the alternatives available to potentially extend the Distributed OSGi spec with some asynchronous messaging concepts/capabilities.
The research is still ongoing, but the intermediate results (including a first demo!</description>

      <description>Ireland (like any other country in the world right now) needs to reinvent itself. The Celtic Tiger (1.0) is over. Question is: What&#39;s next? Do we want a Celtic Tiger 2.0? If so, how should it look like? And how do we make it happen?
Chris Horn has published a couple of interesting blog entries and articles on the topic.
For me the key is skills and innovation. Skill comes in two flavors: expertise and experience.</description>

      <description>Last year I went hill-walking with Andrew and Adrian in Kerry. By now everybody knows the story: I drowned my iPhone in Adrian&#39;s backpack. The backpack was 100% water-proof, means it did not let any water out and at the end of a 4 1/2 hour (irish) survival tour with heavy, &#34;horizontal&#34; rain the iPhone did not pass the &#34;can-your-iPhone-also-work-under-water&#34; test.
I decided to look at it as an opportunity.</description>

      <description>Just found another company offering commercial support for Apache ServiceMix and Apache ActiveMQ (like we do :)). For me this is good news. It shows that more and more people use Apache integration projects in mission-critical deployment scenarios. And that these deployments generate enough value for customers to warrant an &#34;insurance&#34; against worst-case scenarios. 
For me it was never the goal to be the only company to offer consulting, training and support for Apache integration projects.</description>

The result is surprising (and maybe not :)). If you use the &#34;native&#34; formats (e.g. ODF, .key/.page) everything works fine. Obviously things get more interesting, if you want to use these tools to read and write MS-Office files (.</description>

      <description>In the last two month I have put some work into my online presence (website, blog, twitter, linked-in, ...). Obviously I try to minimize the maintenance effort for me, but maximize the user experience for the &#34;customers&#34; of my online presence (I am talking about you, dear reader :)). 
One great tool in this regard is TwitterFeed. It allows you to create &#34;feeds&#34;, which will &#34;listen&#34; on RSS feeds and will then turn them into tweets.</description>

from Falko Riemenschneider. The high-level summary is ...
* Axis 2 is not as easy to use as CXF, but is more ubiquitous in the marketplace (and got better documentation, including a book in german)
* CXF is a very well developed piece of software, but needs more people using it (and needs more/better documentation, including a book in any language, but preferably in english)</description>

      <description>For private reasons I had/have to spend some time in Germany these days. The house of my parents is about 45 mins away from the office, means I get to listen to some podcasts while I am doing 160 miles/hour on the german autobahn. One of my favorite podcasts is the CAOS Theory podcast from the 451 Group.
Yesterday I was listening to one that discussed the current state of affairs with respect to the Open Source Middleware space.</description>

      <description>Yes, we are busy to add new content to FUSEsource :). First we published a/the first set of FUSE TV videos and next we are going to publish a set of &#34;FUSE Quickstart&#34; screen casts. Take a look at the sneak preview and/or wait for the high-res versions to become available on FUSEsource later on this month.
Tip/Hint: The best way to get the sneak preview is to subscribe to the podcast and download all videos into iTunes :).</description>

      <description>The Open Core Licensing discussion is really refreshing! Lots of good ideas and lots of good energy. Obviously the &#34;earlier&#34; versions of the model were more oriented towards a &#34;bait-and-switch&#34; approach (get a good stack for free, but then if you want to do real/serious enterprise computing, you have to to buy the real thing :)). Right now the models have evolved into more mature &#34;suggest-and-complement&#34; models (aka. Open Core Licensing).</description>

      <description>Open Core Licensing and the business model behind it is not (really) new. When you look at it from a history/marketing point of view there are lots of examples, where money is/was made with a &#34;handle-blade&#34; model.
From a marketing point of view the most famous example is probably Gillette. They give away the handles and make a lot of money with the blades. This works because they have a very strong brand and because they &#34;</description>

      <description>(I start to like this &#34;plane blogging&#34; thing :))Adrian blogged about Microsoft embracing AMQP.
Just from a technical point of view this is good news (assuming it will help the adoption of the Advanced Message Queueing Protocol (AMQP)), because AMQP is a very cool (and extremely well thought through) standard.
Given that there might be a renewed interest in the standard, let me just try to explain (again) what it is good for: The main benefit of AMQP (besides a couple of very cool features in the standard itself) is that it will (finally and for the first time) allow messaging stacks to interoperate.</description>

4 weeks ago we huddled in our &#34;new&#34; HQ in Bedford for Managment Meetings (and other fun :)). Debbie had the great idea to take advantage of our presence there and record a first set of FUSE TV sessions. Great fun! Check out the result.
And yes mea culpa, &#34;aaaeeeehhhhhhmmmm&#34; is not a german word. No Oscar for me (this time :)). </description>

      <description>... to FUSEsource.com. As part of the Progress acquisition we decided to change the host/domain name of the FUSE community website from open.iona.com to FUSEsource.com.
I like the new name better, because what we do here is not about a company (be it IONA or Progress). It is about a project. In our case FUSE.
The renaming will also allow us to role out more interesting stuff in the near future on a new, consistent family of good host/domain names.</description>

      <description>Lot&#39;s of interesting exciting stuff is going to happen with FUSE over the next couple of month. 
Especially on the tooling side. The other day I was riding in the car with Oisin Hurley (Head of Tool Development for FUSE) and we discussed the value of having NOT a lot of screen real-estate, because it really makes you think about what the problem is the user wants/needs to solve and how you can guide the user through that process.</description>

      <description>Through the merger (:)) with Progress, I got exposed to the new exciting field of (Real-Time) Complex Event Processing (CEP). There are a couple of obvious use cases in finance (e.g. algorithmic stock trading) and manufacturing (e.g. detecting possible problems in the assembly line, which might effect your just-in-time service-level-agreements).
Complex Event Processing or Intelligent Event Correlation is not what excites me. That was/is also possible using large data-warehouses and suitable data-mining solutions, but then you learn about it after the fact.</description>

But hey ... look at the bright side: I got to replace my 160GB disk with a bigger 250GB disk and got to test, if my Time Machine backup really works.
And there is where the problem starts. In an ill-conceived effort to minimize the disk space and the time I need for my backup, I excluded all directories besides my &#34;</description>

I know need to find out how to make my Twitter tweeds show up in Growl.</description>

Ok, let&#39;s make it as short and as sweet as possible :).
This morning I was reading Matt Aslett&#39;s comment on Andrew Lampitt&#39;s blog entry on &#34;Open-Core&#34; licensing (which actually contains a link to a good presentation by MySQL chief Marten Mickos).
What I like about the approach is that it tries to take the emotion out of the discussion.</description>

      <description>Is Open Source Innovation an oxymoron? Is Open-source fostering innovation or killing it?
There are two school of thoughts out there: First, there are lots of people, who say that open-source is not fostering innovation or even killing it, because it is just about the reimplementation of already solved problems and that it actually kills innovation, because it keeps people from implementing solutions that can not be protected from being reimplemented as an open-source solution.</description>

Right now he is a partner with CIMT AG in Germany. As always talking to him was invigorating. He is one of the most innovative people I know.
The topic of the drive was the future of Solid State Disks (SSDs). His thought was/is that with the arrival of in-expensive, fast SSDs we can potentially rethink the way we structure memory and storage in general.</description>

      <description>The term &#34;software crisis&#34; was coined 1968 by F.L. Bauer during the first NATO Software Engineering Conference in Garmisch, Germany and was used by Dijkstra in his very famous lecture on &#34;The humble programmer&#34;:
[The major cause of the software crisis is] that the machines have become several orders of magnitude more powerful! To put it quite bluntly: as long as there were no machines, programming was no problem at all; when we had a few weak computers, programming became a mild problem, and now we have gigantic computers, programming has become an equally gigantic problem.</description>

      <description>Last week Randy Pausch died. With all the hype around his cancer and &#34;the last lecture&#34;, it was/is kind of hard to see who he was or what he was. Yesterday I tried to find out a little bit more and watched his presentation on time management. Good presentation, but not something that we haven&#39;t heard before. In the end I have to agree with him: He is a smart professor, but there are lots of smart professors out there.</description>

      <description>On Sunday I went to the driving range and while Alexandros was working on my early retirement plan (aka. he making lots of money with golf and I am managing his career), I was reading an article on Businessweek about the new iPhone 3G contracts. The article made me think again. It made me think about two presentations that I saw recently: One by Michael Crossey from Aepona at the Mobile Monday in Belfast and the other one by Peter Moeckel from T-Labs (the R&amp;amp;D think-tank of Deutsche Telekom) at the OSGi community event in Berlin.</description>

there is clearly a need and a benefit to find a solution, but implementations are not available yet (leaving aside lots of POCs that are out there). one obvious driver is the need to find a replacement for cheque payments.</description>

      <description>Two weeks ago I attended the OSGi Community Event in Berlin.
One of the presentations was from Deutsche Bahn about their new Mobile Integration Platform (MIP). It was not only in this presentation that I felt that OSGi has become the ICE of deployment platforms. A 300 km/h high-speed trend/train with a lot of momentum. Think about it: Do you want to be on the train or in front of it.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I went out and had a pint with Sailesh Panchal. He is an Enterprise Architect with the payments division of Lloyds TSB in London. Part of his responsibility is to foster innovation in Lloyds. 
Obviously innovation needs to be directed towards a measurable goal/target/impact for the customer and/or the company. To judge, if an/the idea was just a good idea or a real innovation, you must be able to show some measurable ROI in a defined timeframe.</description>

      <description> Just updated the Link of the Month. It now points to TwitterFone (by Dial2Do). Cool stuff. Traffic in Dublin is a nightmare. Means I am walking a lot. This is the way to Twitter, while you walk (or drive).
Very innovative. </description>

      <description>Monday evening I spent in Belfast at the Mobile Monday, presenting on &#34;How to access WebServices from the iPhone&#34; (pictures are available upon request :)).
Good event. We had 30 people in the room. Good format. Four short presentations with good networking before and after the talks. 
My favorite presentation was Michael Crossey from Aepona, talking about &#34;Exploiting Telco Asserts through Telecom WebServices&#34;. 
One interesting point that he raised is that Mobile Telecom Operators are currently challenged (or even threatend) by &#34;</description>

      <description>The embedded/mobile software market is growing faster than the rest of the industry. From my point of view this just the tip of the iceberg, because we are at the beginning of the sensoric revolution. 
Historically all data got created in the &#34;middle&#34; and we used integration technologies to distribute the data. Web 1.0 turned out to become the preferred mechanism to get this done and we changed the content/data in the middle through the web (e.</description>

      <description>Just finished a/the review of agreat presentation on security and security concepts published by Ciaran McHale on www.ciaranmchale.com.
His claim is that 80% of the the perceived complexity of any given subject is not in the concept, but in the way it is explained to people. His quest is to fix this. Therefore he has started to publish a series of very well written presentations to introduce technical concepts in the most simple way possible.</description>

      <description>Today we went to a local art (flee) market. We were looking for some paintings for our new house. At the end we could not agree on anything, but I was in the right mindset to find something that will focus the mind, when I am at my desk.
I like innovation and I like to innovate. Sometimes this requires to take a leap of faith to produce a quantum leap.</description>

      <description>Now. Lets get things started. Lets talk about innovation. 
for a well-known reason (at least) once a year i am in greece. this year we also went to rhodos to see the colossus. 
question is: was this innovation? i mean, is it innovative to come up with the idea to build something like the colossus?
what is the nature of innovation? how is it for instance different from creativity?</description>

      <description>Yep. It was inevitable. Sooner or later we need to talk about the iPhone.
And there is a lot to talk about ...
