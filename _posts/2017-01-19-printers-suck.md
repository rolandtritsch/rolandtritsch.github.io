---
Last year we visited some of our customers in EMEA to get some video footage about their [Nitro Experience](https://www.gonitro.com/enterprise/?page=customer-success-template&template=howden).

While we had our Creative Director in town (in Dublin), we also decided to shoot some material for some internal videos. Ooohhh ... the fun we had ...

* [Life Nitro: Our Dedication to Development](https://youtu.be/otIJqD6vTwY)
* [Life at Nitro: Our Diversity](https://youtu.be/Q4PznC0WRw4)
* [Nitro: Our Vision for PDF](https://youtu.be/hx4UJJ0GvzU)
* [Life at Nitro: Our Leaders](https://youtu.be/aes30-dBKRI)
* [Nitro: Our Thoughts on Printers](https://youtu.be/BZ61NBcmNyU)

My favorite quote is ... obviously ... "Printers suck!!!". I am with Nitro now for 18 month, but have not configured the office printer yet and have no intentions to do so any time soon, because ... <see above> ... and the damn thing is most of the time in the state that most printers are all the time: Broken and/or not working for reasons that I am not able to comprehend.

Anyway ... enjoy the show :).

PS: 4 weeks afterwards [I channeled the Creative Director in me :)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K8ctbuQcw).
