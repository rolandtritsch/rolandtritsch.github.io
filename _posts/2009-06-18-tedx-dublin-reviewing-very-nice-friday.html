title: TEDx Dublin - Reviewing a very nice friday evening
---

Last friday (means already almost a week ago) I had the chance to attend the first TEDx event in Dublin at the <a href="http://sciencegallery.com/tedxdublin">Science Gallery</a>. To make a long story short ... it was a GREAT event. Great people, great presentations, great location. If you ever get the chance to attend a TEDx event or maybe even to attend a TED conference ... DO IT!!!<div><br /></div><div>Just in case you have never heard about TED I suggest you check out the <a href="http://www.ted.com/">website</a>. There are hundreds of thought-provoking videos and presentations available. TED stands for Technology, Entertainment and Design. TED conferences are held every two years and provide a platform for <b>Ideas Worth Spreading</b>. And my god, some of these ideas are worth spreading indeed.</div><div><br /></div><div>Here are a couple of presentations I found interesting ...

</div><div><ul><li><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/robert_full_learning_from_the_gecko_s_tail.html">Robert Full Learning from the gecko's tail</a></li><li><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/blaise_aguera_y_arcas_demos_photosynth.html">Blaise Aguera y Arcas demos Photosynth</a></li><li><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/al_gore_warns_on_latest_climate_trends.html">Al Gore warns on latest climate trends</a></li><li><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/matthieu_ricard_on_the_habits_of_happiness.html">Matthieu Ricard on the habits of happiness</a></li><li><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/brian_greene_on_string_theory.html">Brian Greene on string theory</a></li><li><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/jill_bolte_taylor_s_powerful_stroke_of_insight.html">Jill Bolte Taylor's stroke of insight</a></li><li><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/pattie_maes_demos_the_sixth_sense.html">Pattie Maes on the Sixth Sense</a></li></ul></div><div>... and there are lots more. </div><div><br /></div><div>Back to the event in Dublin ... we had about 200 people in the room (packed) and the event was very well organized and moderated by <a href="http://aquigley.blogspot.com/2009/06/june-2009-tedxdublin.html">Aaron Quigley</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>The presenters talked about ...</div><div><ul><li><a href="http://www.ted.com/speakers/blaise_aguera_y_arcas.html">Blaise Aguera y Arcas</a> - <a href="http://photosynth.net">Photosynth</a> and ways to construct 3D models from 2D pictures</li><li><a href="http://eleceng.ucd.ie/~srickard">Scott Rickard</a> - <a href="http://sparse.ucd.ie/">Noise Separation and Sparsity</a> (Using DUET to separate the sparsity) </li><li><a href="http://www.hitlabnz.org/wiki/M._Billinghurst">Mark Billinghurst</a> - How to make <a href="http://www.hitlabnz.org/wiki/Video_-_The_Interesting_Mechanism">Augmented Reality (AR)</a> more accessible for the masses</li></ul><div>... and all of the presentations featured live demos of the research results (very impressive). There are <a href="http://fortifyservices.blogspot.com/2009/06/tedx-dublin-overview-and-pics.html">good blog posts</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aquigley">pictures</a> about the event available.</div><div><br /></div><div>My personal favorite was Mark's presentation on AR. Can't wait for the Mac version of <a href="http://www.hitlabnz.org/wiki/BuildAR">BuildAR</a> to become available.</div></div>
