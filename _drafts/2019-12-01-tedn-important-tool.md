... is the laptop? No (but more on this later)!

... is the mobile phone (with good 4G coverage)? No (and again ... more on this later)!

... is a foldable coffee mug!!!

When you start to work remote (from home, from `any place`, ...) you will discover that you will end up in coffee shops (either because you want to (because you want/need to fight the cabin fever) or because you have to (because you want/need to find/have a WLAN connection)).

And then you realize that more often than you want you will end up with a throw-away cup. Dublin alone produces 1M cups per day.

I would suggest that you get yourself a foldable coffee cup. Thank you. Very much appreciated!!!

Mine is from [???]() and is awesome, because you can fold it into 3 sizes (small, medium, large). Highly recommended.
