For private reasons I had/have to spend some time in Germany these days. The house of my parents is about 45 mins away from the office, means I get to listen to some podcasts while I am doing 160 miles/hour on the german autobahn. One of my favorite podcasts is the <a href="http://caostheory.libsyn.com/">CAOS Theory podcast</a> from the 451 Group.<div><br /></div><div>Yesterday I was listening to <a href="http://caostheory.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=400761">one</a> that discussed the current state of affairs with respect to the Open Source Middleware space. One of the conclusions was that FUSE will probably benefit from the ProgressÂ acquisition, because Progress made a clear commitment to Open Source and will increase the investment in FUSE.</div><div><br /></div><div>Just for the record: These conclusions are correct.</div>
