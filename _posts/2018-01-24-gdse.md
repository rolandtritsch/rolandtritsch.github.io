[MOOCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course) (Massive Open Online Courses) are massive!!!

I did my first one 7 years ago (on Cousera; Martin Odersky's course on Functional Programming with Scala).

Since then there has been an explosion of sites and [offerings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course). By now it is clear that, if you do not know, how to use these sites to your own advantage you are putting yourself at a competitive disadvantage (from a skills development point of view).

In Q4 I tried [edx.org](https://www.edx.org) and took the course on [Globally Distributed Software Engineering](https://www.edx.org/course/globally-distributed-software-delftx-gse101x). Good refresher on [Dunbar's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number) and the [Allen curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_curve).

Good experience. Recommended.
