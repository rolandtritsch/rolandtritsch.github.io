How to write an article ...

* clone the repo
* note: this is a `site` repository, not a `project` repository, means you do not need to maintain the pages on a `gh-pages` branch (means everything is on `master`)
* write the blog post and put it in `_posts`
* check with `rvm list` that the correct ruby version is set (at least `2.3.1`)
* run `bundle exec jekyll server` to run a local jekyll server
* check the article for correctness
* commit and push the changes

... and you are done.
