title: Penny ... everything is better with ... blockchain :)

In terms of technologies right now I am very much focused on Functional Programming and Machine Learning and Software Engineering for Mobile Devices and ... a couple of other things (Rust, Go, ...), but wanted to dedicate a blog post to a technology that will (IMHO) have a significant impact on our future: Blockchains (or more specfically the [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) project).

Why are we talking about this ...

... because everything is better with blockchain :).

Last week I was in SF and I did a [Lunch & Learn on Blockchain Technology and Document Management](http://www.tritsch.org/reveal-presentations/blockchain_2016-10-10/meetup.html) and what it can potentially mean to a company like Nitro.

The essence here is that with the introduction of an "active" blockchain technology like Ethereum you can build all kinds of smart contracts. It is a blockchain on steroids.

I think we only begin to understand what that means and what kind of impact this can have.

Exciting!!!
