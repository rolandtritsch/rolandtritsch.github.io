title: Effective Android - Using Apache CXF to access SOAP services
---

A year ago I developed a small set of demos to show how to<a href="http://blog.tritsch.org/2008/04/apache-cxf-generates-client-side-soap.html" target="_blank"> access SOAP services from the iPhone</a>. To do this I used a very interesting feature of Apache CXF: The ability to generate a complete <a href="http://cwiki.apache.org/CXF20DOC/javascript-clients.html">JavaScript client-side SOAP-stack</a> on the fly.<br /><div><br /></div><div>I just finished an update/upgrade of this demo to show <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rolandtritsch/3601394870/">that it also works with the Android Phone</a>. I also ported it to maven, means installing, building and running the demo is much easier now. The source code and the maven build environment is available on <a href="https://github.com/rolandtritsch/iPhone-Android-Apache-CXF-Soap-Services" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>Enjoy :). </div>
