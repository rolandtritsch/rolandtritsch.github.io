      <description>Note: Look here for 3.0 benchmark numbers
The release of Scala3 is imminent.
In April I ported/migrated nmesos from Scala2 to Scala3 and I just did a quick benchmark to see what Scala3 is doing to my Advent-of-Code implementation from 2017.
Initially I was wondering (and maybe a little bit afraid) how difficult migrating to Scala3 will be (and what problems I will be running into).
The good news is that migrating to Scala3 is not difficult at all.</description>

      <description>A couple of month ago I started to have stomach cramps. First it was only once week, but then it was more or less constant.
Funny enough I had to find out that (even) late(r) in life you can &amp;ldquo;become&amp;rdquo; gluten-sensitive/-intolerant. Means &amp;hellip; a couple of weeks ago I got myself tested and changed my diet (to (mostly) gluten-free) and (big surprise !!!) &amp;hellip; after 3 days I was pain free!</description>

      <description>Last week I was in London attending Code Elixir LDN 2019 delivering a lightening talk on 3 languages in 3 minutes &amp;hellip;
 This was my first Elixir conference. We had about 100 people there. The conference was very well organized. From what I can see London is one the Elixir hotspots in Europe.
All of the talks where good, but a couple of them where of even better value to me personally (because I am the newbie) &amp;hellip;</description>
