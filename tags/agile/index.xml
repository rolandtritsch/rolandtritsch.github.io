      <description>The other day I was explaining again how to build an MVP and I was using the skateboard picture (again :)).
In the middle of the discussion I realized that we only had half of the discussion, because we only talked about the direct benefits of the approach: Fast feedback, less risk to build the wrong thing, &amp;hellip;
We did not really talk about the cost of getting these benefits. The meeting got interesting when I started to point out that this is not about building the solution the fastest way or the cheapest way.</description>
