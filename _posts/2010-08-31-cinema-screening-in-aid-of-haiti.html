Sometimes it is possible to combine something that is fun with something that is useful.<div><br /></div><div>I am happy to present such an opportunity, since my colleague Susan O'Hara is organizing a charity event in the <a href="http://www.thesugarclub.com">Sugar Club on Lower Leeson Street</a> to watch <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commitments_(film)">"The Commitments"</a> on Wednesday,  15 September 2010 at 7pm.</div><div><br /></div><div>The cost is EUR 15,- pp. The feeling to have some fun and do something good is priceless.</div><div><br /></div><div>For all inquires, please feel free to contact <a href="mailto:susanmaryohara@hotmail.com">Susan</a> directly. Hope to see you there :).</div>
