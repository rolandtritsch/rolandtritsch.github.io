title: TEDN - Working remote ... 50 shades of grey!
---
A couple of years ago an engineer approached me and asked/suggested to work from home.

We talked about it and we tried it and ... 6 month later we concluded that we had the wrong end of the stick.

Let me explain ...

When people talk about working remote and/or working from home (by now) it is my experience that there are two othogonal questions that need to be explored ...

1. Do you want to work from home or do you want to work part time (including working part time from the office)?

1. Do you want to work from home or from any place?

Answering these two questions will help to come up with quadrant that can put a much better structure into finding a good/suitable solution for the individual.

| Full-Time | Part-Time
--- | --- | ---
Office | ??? | ???
Home | ??? | ???
Any Place | ??? | ???

In my case it turned out that we had not (really) talked about this and the solution was not to work from home, but to work part-time from the office.
