title: TEDN - The right HW/OS?
---
Hhhmmm ... how should I put this?

It is now more than 15 years that I got my first MacBook (switching from Windows). Very easy to use. No reboot nonsense. Very good/robust HW, that virtually never breaks. With an operating system that just works.

But ... over the last 5 years, things have changed. Every time a new MacBook comes out it has new HW and SW features that I do not necessarily perceive as improvements (e.g. touchbar, replace the MagSafe power adapter (with a USB-C port), ...) and MacOS has started to behave weird (e.g. booting itself, not picking up audio equipment, ...) and then you have to buy new adapters (for almost everything).

On top of that most of the production environments these days (at least in my case) run on Ubuntu.

So ... I started to look at alternatives. First I was running Ubuntu (on a couple of my old MacBooks (without the touchbar and with MagSafe)), but then I decided to go all-in and got myself a new Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition (with Ubuntu) on it.

Best descison ever!!!

* Works well
* Good battery live
* Extra battery pack
* Small enough to work on the plane
