      <description>&lt;p&gt;I can hear you loud and clear &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ooohhh my god: Not another blog post about AI!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bear with me. I will try to make reading it (or watching it) worth&#xA;while your time. I promise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kv_MwUVFn8A?si=z-4uzFDJEsrboMsq&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s set the stage. My opinion is &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The planet has problems (over-population, climate-change, poverty and&#xA;economic inequality, cancer and alzheimer, &amp;hellip;). AI is coming. And I&#xA;believe AI can help us to solve some of these problems or make them&#xA;more managable (e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaFold&#34;&gt;AlphaFold&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>IOM TT 2024 - History was made</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ok, here comes an odd one &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This one is not about software-technologies or software-engineering or&#xA;software-craftmanship or management or leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is about another passion of mine: Motorbikes and motorbike&#xA;racing. Specifically road-racing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For those of you who know nothing about road-racing and want to learn&#xA;and understand more I recommend to watch &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLI2r8pyla0&#34;&gt;Road&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The exec summary is that all racing started on open, public&#xA;roads. Later purpose build tracks started to emerge and are obviously&#xA;the much safer option to conduct a race. For motorbikes and cars&#xA;alike.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Our goal is to spread the word of our core values,&#xA;be mentors for the new developers and create software that it is&#xA;developed at the highest quality bar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every software gardener believes and embraces the following:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a landmark blog post. I just introduced a tag called&#xA;&lt;code&gt;Augmented-by-AI&lt;/code&gt;. And this post is tagged with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://tedn.life/images/2023-04-09-augmented-blogging/roland.jpg&#34;&#xA;style=&#34;float:right; margin:auto&#34; width=&#34;20%&#34; hspace=&#34;5%&#34; vspace=&#34;1%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is going to be the new normal. Let me explain &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First things first: This blog post is not written by &lt;code&gt;chatGPT&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is Sunday morning, 6am and I am sitting here in my living room in&#xA;my PJ with a cup of coffee and I am typing this.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This blog post is interesting in more than one way, because &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I am going to discuss a topic that is deer to my heart: What do we&#xA;need to do to get to a better place with respect to a sustainable&#xA;energy future?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And I am going to use a new approach: Where I am first going to&#xA;articulate my thoughts and then I am going to complement it with a&#xA;fireside chat that I had with &lt;code&gt;chatGPT&lt;/code&gt; about the topics at hand.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here we go &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Lencioni&#34;&gt;Patrick Lencioni&lt;/a&gt; (obviously) wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team&#34;&gt;The Five Dysfunctions&#xA;of a Team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b6/The5dysfunctionsofateam.png&#34; style=&#34;float:right; margin:auto&#34; width=&#34;20%&#34; hspace=&#34;5%&#34; vspace=&#34;1%&#34;/&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In that book we learn that the five dysfunctions you need to avoid are&#xA;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Absence of trust — unwilling to be vulnerable within the group&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fear of conflict — seeking artificial harmony over constructive&#xA;passionate debate&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lack of commitment — feigning buy-in for group decisions creates&#xA;ambiguity throughout the organization&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Avoidance of accountability — ducking the responsibility to call&#xA;peers, superiors on counterproductive behavior which sets low&#xA;standards&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Inattention to team results — focusing on personal success, status&#xA;and ego before team success&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I always try to frame these in positive/actionable terms by asking&#xA;people to help me to build teams that show/exhibit the following&#xA;characteristics &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Can we afford to be surprised? - &#34;Hot, hot, hot&#34;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;6 years ago I wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;https://tedn.life/2016/02/08/why-are-we-surprised-hot-hot-hot/&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; to express that my&#xA;wife loves me for a lot of different reasons and that there is no&#xA;reason to be surprised about the climate change that we are&#xA;experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;http://tedn.life/images/2023-01-14-surprise-II/micro.jpg&#34; style=&#34;display:block; margin:auto&#34; width=&#34;80%&#34; hspace=&#34;1%&#34; vspace=&#34;1%&#34;/&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note: If you do not know, why there is a picture of a microwave here,&#xA;you need to read the &lt;a href=&#34;https://tedn.life/2016/02/08/why-are-we-surprised-hot-hot-hot/&#34;&gt;first blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am compelled to write about it again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mainly because it did not get better. It got worse. And I do not mean&#xA;the climate change. That was to be expected (at least by some of us).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As of today I am not &lt;code&gt;tweeting&lt;/code&gt;&#xA;anymore. I am &lt;code&gt;tooting&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;a href=&#34;https://gizmodo.com/mastodon-toot-retired-twitter-tweet-equivalent-1849786221&#34;&gt;not&lt;/a&gt;).

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago I got my second jab. I am fully vaccinated now. I am now in Germany to see my parents for the first time in 12 month.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes: It is finally happening! The pandemic (slowly, but surely) comes to an end.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which creates (for some of us and for some companies) a big question: What&amp;rsquo;s the next step? What&amp;rsquo;s the path forward (e.g. from a organisational structure/development point of view)?. We all work from home right now (if we want it or not). Do we want to continue to work from home (double-down on remote-first)? Or go back to the office (revitalize a hub-first office culture)? Or go hybrid?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now it is (almost) official: The pandemic is over (or is coming to an end fast/soon). In the next couple of days I am going to get my second shoot. Last week I was staying for 5 days in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rivervalleypark.ie&#34;&gt;River Valley Holiday Park&lt;/a&gt; (first time in 12 month that I was able to do a multi-day_trip with &lt;a href=&#34;https://tedn.life/2020/04/14/the-tedn-van&#34;&gt;the TEDN van&lt;/a&gt;). And next week I am going to Germany (and I am going to stay there for a month).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Distances - Know them. Manage them.</title>

      <guid>http://tedn.life/2021/06/01/distances-know-them.-manage-them./</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Building and managing remote-first organizations means that you also need to understand (and manage) distances!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To develop your ability to understand and manage distances is very important because human beings naturally need closeness (to other people and/or the purpose of the endeavor) to feel a sense of belonging.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But &amp;hellip; wait a sec: What do you mean by &lt;strong&gt;distances&lt;/strong&gt; (plural)? Is there more than one?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Big surprise: Yes! When I build and run remote-first organizations I worry about and manage at least the following distances &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>(The Extreme) 100 Day Walking Challenge</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In January I had a good call with my friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bragg.com.au/complimentary-coaching-session&#34;&gt;Braggy&lt;/a&gt; in Sydney. The insight was, that 2020 was different to what I/we expected, but with 20/20 hint-sight it was not necessarily a bad a year (at least not for me).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The pandemic forced me to question what I am doing and why I am doing it and how I am doing it in a lot of interesting ways. I will always remember 2020 as a year where I grew a lot, albeit in unexpected ways/directions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://community.com&#34;&gt;Community&lt;/a&gt; is growing fast.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More business. More customers. More people. More money. More (necessary) complexity (software and people).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;http://tedn.life/images/2020-08-31-staff-director/roland.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;float: left;&#34; width=&#34;30%&#34; height=&#34;30%&#34; hspace=&#34;30&#34; vspace=&#34;10&#34;/&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The demand for this kind of growth can create a lot of interesting strains, problems and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In situations like this it is easy to end up between a rock and a hard place: Grow fast and run a/the risk that the growing pains will kill you or end up being too slow to fully capitalize on the magnitude of the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

What is the origin? What are other well-known usages?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is what I found out &amp;hellip;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/RolandBremen01.jpg&#34; style=&#34;float: left;&#34; width=&#34;30%&#34; height=&#34;50%&#34; hspace=&#34;30&#34; vspace=&#34;10&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland&#34;&gt;Roland&lt;/a&gt; was a knight who fought for Charles the Great (also called the father of Europe). His life is the source of legends and his last fight at the Battle of Roncesvalles in 778 was turned into the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Song_of_Roland&#34;&gt;Song of Roland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In Germany Roland is also famous for the statue on the market place in &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bremen_Roland&#34;&gt;Bremen&lt;/a&gt;. The name of Roland&amp;rsquo;s sword is &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durendal&#34;&gt;Durendal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.roland.com&#34;&gt;Roland&lt;/a&gt; is the name of a japanese maker of music equipment. The company was founded in 1972 and has 3000 employees. A lot of very famous &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rolandus.com/artists&#34;&gt;artists&lt;/a&gt; use Roland equipment and you can see a lot of Roland keyboards on stage during live concerts. The rumour is that the company was named after the Song of Roland, but apparently the name was just chosen because it was easy to pronounce and stands out easily on trade-shows.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xrwB-qu-ASQ?controls=0&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The dust has settled. All opinions have been voiced. All articles have been written. Not quite &amp;hellip; here is another one :).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am struggling with Donald Trump and his character and his personality and his opinions. A lot!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And what do to next depend first of all on, if you believe that there is a problem or not and what that problem is. It then comes down to what to do to fix the problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Getting GTD done - Thoughts and Tools</title>

      <description>We all have a lot to do. Effective time/task management is essential. I’ve been using GTD (Getting Things Done) for a while now (a long while :)) and for me it comes down to the question, “How do you pick the next, best, most valuable thing to work on?”—basically answering the question of how to make the best use of the time you have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picking something from your list of urgent things to do is kind of easy, but how can you make sure you are not missing the opportunity/chance to work on something important, if you get the chance to do so?&#xA;&#xA;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy! Just do &lt;a href=&#34;http://inboxzero.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Inbox-Zero&lt;/a&gt; and use &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GTD&lt;/a&gt; (Getting Things Done), read the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;7 Habbits of highly effective people&lt;/a&gt; and work through the stuff in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.43folders.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;43folders&lt;/a&gt; and ... problem solved, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aim of this blog post is to share some of my thoughts on how to become effective or even better maybe only become more effective than you are today and what tools to use and how to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First let&#39;s be clear: It all starts with yourself. You need to be clear and serious about what you want to get out of life and what is important to you. The stuff above will help you to get organized, but it will not make you happy (at least this is true for myself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What has helped me is to think about golf balls. You know? &lt;a href=&#34;http://theocgproject.com/2012/11/20/golf-balls-pebbles-and-beer-an-analogy-for-life-by-author-unknown/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The story&lt;/a&gt; about the professor that teaches philosophy and is pouring sand and beer into a bucket? Means every 6 to 12 month I am making sure to set aside half a day with a friend or on my own and think about the golf balls that need to go into the bucket. Sometimes I am adding one (easy), but then I am also making sure that I am removing one (hard). I try not to have more than 5 golf balls in the bucket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other good way to look at it is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gtdtimes.com/2011/01/26/the-6-horizons-of-focus/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&#34;flight-level&#34; approach&lt;/a&gt; that is suggested by David Allen to put structure into GTD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here comes the first tip or trick: Originally I had all of that in one place (e.g. your GTD tool of choice). For me personally that was bad in 2 ways: First, I was looking at it way too often and second, the list-view way of looking at my purpose, vision, goals just did not resonate with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of years ago I started to maintain my high(er) level believes (e.g. 50k, 40k, 30k) in a very expressive and colourful &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;mindmap&lt;/a&gt;. To maintain the mindmap I am using &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeMind&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FreeMind&lt;/a&gt;. And then I am printing it and put it somewhere, where I can see it (at home). This works very well for me. I look at it a lot and most of the time it makes me smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Means I am using my GTD tool only for the lower &#34;flight-levels&#34; and the runway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let&#39;s talk a little bit about my GTD tool. I have tried a lot (not naming names), but like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;OmniFocus&lt;/a&gt; most/best. The only big problem with OmniFocus is that it does not support Android. If one of these days I find a tool that is as good as OmniFocus and supports Android, I will switch to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using OmniFocus or any other GTD tool comes with it&#39;s own set of challenges. Most of the time the tools feature a tutorial and suggest a way to use it. In the case of OmniFocus and for me this did not really work well. It took me a while to figure out how to make OmniFocus work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;For me it comes down to one very important question:&lt;/b&gt; Assuming that you are done doing something, how do you pick the next task? And this is where the rubber hits the road and this is where the tutorials start to fail, because this is really something that you have to figure out for yourself. The tutorial might suggest that you need to structure it along the lines of projects or locations (at home, in the office) or if you have your laptop or a phone. For me none of this matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am picking my next task based on urgency and importance. Sounds familiar? So far, so good. As always urgency is easy. Every task got a due date and you just sort the tasks by due date and you will be able to find out what you need get done in the next couple of days. In OmniFocus I am using the Due perspective and that works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I also created a second perspective for myself that I call &lt;b&gt;the Do perspective&lt;/b&gt;. And that perspective helps me to find tasks that I can do that are not necessarily urgent. I thought about this a lot and for me there are two dimensions/questions that I use to pick something from that list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do I need somebody to make progress on this task or can I do it on my own?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How long will this take?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;So let&#39;s say, later in the day and I suddenly have 10m, 30m, 60m or more than 60m to do something and I am done with my urgent list. I then go to my Do list/perspective which is sorted by how long a task will take and find the tasks fit into the time that I have. 10m might be a call, 30m might be to followup with somebody on an important project. In the best case I am picking a big/long task which needs a lot of people, because in general these are difficult ones. In the worst case, either because I do not have a lot of time or because nobody is around/awake, I am picking a short task that I can do on my own. &lt;b&gt;But it is very important to favour the longest possible task and if possible one that requires other people, because to find a slot for a short task that you can do on your own is easy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-J36j4YegC98/UhHd0Ti1UlI/AAAAAAAAAGY/lihJwzKsyyU/s1600/Time+vs.+Need.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-J36j4YegC98/UhHd0Ti1UlI/AAAAAAAAAGY/lihJwzKsyyU/s640/Time+vs.+Need.png&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;To make this work I give every task a duration. I am only using 3 durations: 10m, 30m and 60m (or more). For tasks that I am delegating I am using 100h, because this task has no duration for me. The thing with the 100h is important, so that I can see the tasks that have no duration, which in my case is an indication that something went wrong. If I would use no duration as a valid value, I would not be able to find the tasks that are not configured correctly.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Finally I am using contexts to express, if I need somebody for a task or not. I have two sub-groups: &#34;Need help from ...&#34; and &#34;Waiting for ...&#34;. In &#34;Need help from ...&#34; I have a context call &#34;Nobody&#34; and a long, ever-growing list of people and groups of people that I need to get something done. Means every time I am processing a task in my inbox I decide quickly, if I want/can do this alone/on my own and if so assign it to the &#34;Need help from ... &amp;gt; Nobody&#34; context. Otherwise I pick the person or group I need to make progress with this task. If it is not me who owns the task I am assigning it a person in the &#34;Waiting for ...&#34; sub-group. In that sub-group I only have people, no groups, because when I am delegating something, I am delegating it to a person, not to a group of people. All of the contexts on &#34;Waiting for ...&#34; are configured to be in status &#34;On Hold&#34; and I have a perspective to show me all tasks that I have delegated. Needless to say, when I am delegating a task I set it up in a way so that I do not have to poll for progress, but agree a way of working together so that progress reports and updates are pushed to me.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is how all of this comes together:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most of the time I use the &#34;quick entry&#34; keyboard shortcut or the &#34;Send to OmniFocus&#34; clipping feature to put something into my Inbox. Especially while processing email. More on this later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Once a day I am going through my inbox and give the task a project, a context, a due date and a duration. I do this for every task. This needs to be quick. To make this quick I am using a couple of &#34;short-cuts&#34;/simplifications (features of OmniTi and GTD that I am not using at all or in a different way). This means for instance that I am not thinking about &#34;does this task need a due date or not&#34;. I always give it a due date. If it is not urgent the due date might be in 3 month from now. But this way I have squared it away and have clearly expressed that it is not urgent and that is also important.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another short-cut is that I only have a very small amount of projects. Most of the time I am only using two Single-Action projects. One for my personal tasks and one for my business tasks. This makes finding the right project for a task very fast. I am not using OmniFocus for Project Planning or Project Management (for that I am using OmniPlan). I am mainly using OmniFocus for task management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After that I take a look at my Due perspective and my Do perspective and pick the best task for the first time slot that I have.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;One of my urgent, reoccurring tasks is to clean my EMail-Inbox. I normally do this twice a day. Once in the morning and once in the evening. And I normally do it before I process my GTD-Inbox. But just to give you an idea, I normally have 100 emails in my EMail-Inbox and I process it in 10-15 mins and cleaning up my GTD-Inbox normally takes less than 5 mins. I am very strict not do anything while I am processing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So last, but not least lets talk about email. Again how you are doing your inbox processing or your Inbox-Zero is very much a question of personal taste. My system has 3 labels or folders: NeedsAction, Keep and Archive. The one thing that is important for me is that moving emails to these folders/labels has a keyboard short-cut associated with it. I am using mail.app and it took me a while to figure out how to make this happen, but &lt;a href=&#34;http://support.apple.com/kb/PH3957&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;with Mac OS 10.8 it is possible to assign keys to menu items&lt;/a&gt;, means in my case I have&amp;nbsp;Ctrl-J, Ctrl-K, Ctrl-L assigned to&amp;nbsp;&#34;Message &amp;gt; Move to &amp;gt; NeedsAction&#34;,&amp;nbsp;&#34;Message &amp;gt; Move to &amp;gt; Keep&#34;, &#34;Message &amp;gt; Move to &amp;gt; Archive&#34;. With that I am flying through my inbox very fast. NeedsAction includes everything that takes longer than a minute to do. This includes reading a long email or even responding to an email. Sometimes I start to work on an email, but after a minute I start to feel that this will take 10m or maybe even 30m. At that point I stop working on that email and just put it into NeedsAction. In a second pass I am going through the NeedsAction folder and either do it or turn it into a GTD task (including the tasks I want to delegate). I do it this way to make sure that I do not keep tasks in my email. If I am not strict on this, then I start to maintain 2 lists, which makes picking the next best task hard(er).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ssssoooo ... that&#39;s about it!!! This is how I get things done with GTD. As I said most of it is a question of personal style. My style is maybe more task/action oriented than other people. Maybe other people prefer to think about what needs to get done more in the context of projects, but what have described here works for me. But this might be the most important take away from this post: Create a task to really think about how you are getting things done and what information you need to make good decisions on what task to tackle next. Spending an hour on it and implementing it afterwards, might be a good investment in your future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Last but not least, I would love to hear from you how you use/organise your projects and contexts in OmniFocus or any other tool you are using.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am now going to take a look at my Due and Do perspective to pick something that I can do in the next 30 mins, before I have to go to my next meeting.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>These days I am writing more source code again (mostly Scala) and decided to (re)read a couple of books to refresh some thoughts and ideas and believes that I always had when it comes to writing source code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the books I was (re)reading was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Clean Code&lt;/a&gt; and there are lots of good ideas in it, e.g. after reading the book 15 years ago I got into the habit of refactoring, whenever I feel the urge to put a comment in the code, which is an indication that the code is not clear/self-documenting enough. The only comments I am writing these days are comments on why the code is doing what it is doing, not what it is doing (that should be apparent from the code itself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway ...&#xA;&#xA;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was reading Clean Code one of the Gilt engineers in Dublin recommended to also take a look at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Pragmatic Programmer&lt;/a&gt; and I just finished it two weeks ago. The book is more compact than Clean Code. If you have the time, read both. If not, just read the Pragmatic Programmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two thoughts/pictures resonated with me ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer/extracts/software-entropy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Broken Windows&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://chrisaitchison.com/2011/05/03/you-are-not-a-software-engineer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Software Gardening&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;Broken Windows is about fighting Software Entropy and puts a nice picture/story around the concept that you should always check-in the code a little bit cleaner than you found it. Be clean and if you find a broken window (that somebody else broke), fix it! That behavior can be omnipresent in your life. I live in Ireland and do a lot of hill-walking and the rule is whatever you carry up the hill, you will also carry down, but you can take that a step further and pick up cans and bottles that you find on the hill (my habit to pick up litter wherever I find it drives my wife nuts) and leave the hill cleaner than you found it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Software Gardening puts our ambitions to construct software into perspective. If you construct something (e.g. a bridge) it is kind of static. The idea is that software engineering is more like gardening and less like construction. The software system has a life on its own. It grows. Initially you have an idea how the garden should look like and put the flowers and the bushes and the trees into place, but then over time you need to make sure you also spend some time on pruning and refactoring to keep the garden in shape, because it has a life on its own.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Here is a picture of me looking through a window into my garden.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lCKPYC6DUNM/UR9r6nkNbtI/AAAAAAAAAD0/exfviexynBA/s1600/2013-02-16+10.13.06.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lCKPYC6DUNM/UR9r6nkNbtI/AAAAAAAAAD0/exfviexynBA/s1600/2013-02-16+10.13.06.jpg&#34; height=&#34;320&#34; width=&#34;240&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Hi &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12537129-ugo-matrangolo&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ugo&lt;/a&gt;, thanks for the pointer ...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>These days (and especially after the Amazon EC2 outage :)) everybody is talking about cloud computing. It seems you cannot be sexy, if you do not &#34;live&#34; in the cloud. But most of the more &#34;common&#34; users (and for the sake of the discussion, I am including myself in that group) probably think that cloud computing and using &#34;the cloud&#34; is something that enterprises use to (potentially) safe cost and also to (potentially) gain flexibility.&#xA;&#xA;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The first observation is that there is a fair amount of confusion about what cloud computing is. The reason is that everybody is latching on to the buzz and is using the word cloud to make the product or the service at hand look more trendy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;To bring order to the chaos you could probably say that there are three categories of cloud computing solutions:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data Clouds - Give access to a large amount of disk space and allow the disk space to be shared between a (potentially) large number of users (e.g. DropBox)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Computing Clouds - Give access to large amount of computing (CPU) and hardware power in general (including main memory, disk space and in most cases a/the operating system) to run whatever application you want to run (e.g. Amazon EC2)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Services/Application Clouds - Give access to ready-to-run/ready-to-use services/application to solve a specific problem (e.g. Google Mail (running a mail server for you), GitHub (running a source code repository for you), SalesForce.com (running a CRM for you))&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;So question becomes, why is this important or relevant to a/the common (means non-enterprise) user? For me personally I get two benefits out of it: I use &#34;cloud computing&#34; as a (you could call it) &#34;poor-mans backup solution&#34; and also as an &#34;information sharing/syncing solution&#34;. Specifically I am using ...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Google Mail/Calendar - to &#34;host/store&#34; all my email folders, contacts and my personal calendar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DropBox - to store all my files (including picture and music libraries)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GitHub - to store all my source code&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;Syncing the data is kind of automatic and there is always an offline version of the data available, which gives me very good protection against disk failures (but on top of that I am also running a TimeMachine backup (better safe than sorry :))), means in case of a disk failure, I can install an IMAP email client, a DropBox client and Git on a new piece of hardware and I am up and running again in no time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The second value is information sharing. By now I have 3 devices (laptop, tablet, phone) and need to share/sync data between the devices and my wife got a laptop and a phone too and I also need to share/sync information with her (especially my source code :)). Having the data/information available in &#34;the cloud&#34; makes that syncing/sharing exercise straight forward (will publish a blog post on how to share/sync music using DropBox in due course).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Buttom line: &#34;Cloud computing&#34; is not only for enterprises :). &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Managing complexity with OSGi - In bundles and between bundles</title>

      <description>&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Right now the &lt;a href=&#34;http://sp.brandvis.com/&#34;&gt;Brandvis SelectPortal system&lt;/a&gt; is based on Microsoft .NET and we constantly improve it and add features. While we do this we also constantly refactor the system to eliminate complexity to make it easier to maintain/extend.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Triggered by this work and triggered by a talk on reuse of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.osgi.org/&#34;&gt;OSGi&lt;/a&gt; bundles that I attended a couple of years ago, I started to think about complexity again. The main conclusion of that thought process is that there is probably an optimal (means minimal) complexity for any given system.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;To get to that optimal level of complexity you constantly refactor the system (because there is no chance in hell that you will get it right the first time around by thinking about it and then implementing it) and change the granularity/size of your reusable software artifacts (classes, bundles, services).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Getting the granularity/size (and the responsibilities) of a reusable software artifact right, is probably the holy-grail of software engineering and there is no easy answer, because if you cut it too small and build the system from a lot of very simple, small software artifacts the complexity and dependencies and relationships between the artifacts get out of hand. Going the other way you can try to reduce the complexity of the system, by building it from larger software artifacts, but then these artifacts itself will become more complex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vFsfIMARfBI/UFY2VOueY5I/AAAAAAAAAC4/QnejRn1l8hw/s1600/OSGiBundles.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vFsfIMARfBI/UFY2VOueY5I/AAAAAAAAAC4/QnejRn1l8hw/s640/OSGiBundles.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That means that in any case you need to build your system on a software platform that allows you to iterate on getting the granularity of the software artifacts right. I believe OSGi is such a platform.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Bierdeckel Economics vs. Armchair Economics - ... and what it got to do with Greece and Ireland</title>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;As most of you know, I am married to a greek woman and life in Ireland. Therefore the current economic crisis is omnipresent in my life.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;A couple of weeks ago &lt;a href=&#34;http://chrisjhorn.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;Chris Horn&lt;/a&gt; posted an &lt;a href=&#34;http://chrisjhorn.wordpress.com/2010/02/11/armchair-economics/&#34;&gt;interesting article&lt;/a&gt; about certain economical key indicators and what they mean for Ireland. I also saw a &lt;a href=&#34;http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/18/will-the-u-s-become-the-next-ireland/&#34;&gt;good article in the NYT&lt;/a&gt; about why and how the US and Ireland and Greece are different (from a financial crises/debt point of view).&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now I can&#39;t resist anymore: I have to write up my own &#34;Bierdeckel&#34; assessment of where we are (in Germany we say, that if you can&#39;t explain it by writing it up on the back of a beermat its not any good. The beermat thing became famous 5 years ago when Friedrich Merz suggested that you should be able to do your &lt;a href=&#34;http://kinggolo.vox.com/library/post/life-is-complicated-tax-form-terror.html&#34;&gt;Tax Return on the back of a beermat&lt;/a&gt;).&#xA;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The main purpose of the exercise is to come to my own conclusions on, how deep the sh... is we are in and to summarize it in a way that will allow us to grab the essence of the problem on a page. Here we go ...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;To start I have to say that I do not share the obsession with the &#34;Budget Deficit as percentage of GDP&#34; as being the biggest problem of all. I agree it is a good early warning indicator that there is (maybe) something about to go wrong, but a budget deficit of more than 3% (the Maastrich-Criteria) is no reason to panic. Just think about it: Because the impact and significants of borrowing a certain amount of money (or increasing your debt) clearly depends on your ability to pay it back (your income),  it obviously does not make sense to express budget deficits as absolut numbers, because a budget deficit of EUR 1000M might be a problem for a small country (with less (tax) income), but not problem for a bigger country. Therefore expressing the budget deficit as percentage of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product&#34;&gt;GDP&lt;/a&gt; (Gross Domestic Product) make sense (Warning: currently some people try to confuse the situation by expressing key indicators as percentages of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measures_of_national_income_and_output&#34;&gt;GNP&lt;/a&gt; (Gross National Product). That does not make sense and is dangerous, because the numbers might look better, but the problem is not smaller).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My point is now, that a budget deficit of &gt;3% (e.g. 12% for Greece, Ireland, ...) is not a problem. Just imagine you have a debt free country and in (one) given year you need to borrow some money to get things back to normal and to make some investments and then you pay it back over a period of 10 years. I don&#39;t think that this is a problem.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The problem is, what happens if you keep on doing this. Then (over the years) you will accumulate dept and this is a key indicator that is much more interesting. Again it probably does not make sense to look at absolute numbers and it is probably much more telling to look at &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_public_debt#cite_note-3&#34;&gt;debt as percentage of GDP&lt;/a&gt;. Here are a couple of examples (2009) ...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zimbabwe - 303%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Japan - 192%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Italy - 115%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Greece - 108%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;France - 79%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Germany - 77%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK - 68%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ireland - 63%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;USA - 53%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;China - 18%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Equatorial Guinea - 2%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;From that list you can clearly see that Japan, Italy and Greece are in trouble.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The reason why this is a problem is interest. Obviously if you borrow money you need to pay it back, but you also need to pay interest on it (sorry, I am obviously teaching cranny how to suck eggs here, but when I see what some politicians do, I start to wonder). And you need to pay this interest from your income (the taxes your citizens pay). If you now accumulate to much debt and/or your credit rating goes down, your interest payments go up and that can become a real problem, because at the end they might eat up a huge amount of your income, leaving you with very little to spend on infrastructure (and other investment) projects. Therefore the next better metric is to look at interest payments as percentage of GDP. Unfortunately I was not able to find any current data, but here are &lt;a href=&#34;http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m4456/is_2002_Dec/ai_98032799/&#34;&gt;some examples from 2004 (estimated)&lt;/a&gt; , which will give us some indication ...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;France - 2.8%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Germany - 3.3%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Greece - 5.1% (questionable, this was probably higher)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ireland - 0%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Italy - 5.4%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK - 1.8%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;USA - 2.0%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;Update: Just found &lt;a href=&#34;http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/publication_summary16053_en.htm&#34;&gt;better more current/accurate data&lt;/a&gt;, which confirms the trend. Here we go (estimations for 2011) ...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Germany - 2.9%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ireland - 4.0%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Greece - 6.1%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;France - 3.0%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Italy - 5.1%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;USA - 3.2%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the case of Greece it means that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eliamep.gr/en/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Fact-Sheet-Greece-200911.pdf&#34;&gt;in 2009 they had to spend more than 10% of the annual budget to service debt&lt;/a&gt;. This is a huge iron ball around the leg to carry around.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ireland is different. Ireland got a fighting chance, because Ireland has much less accumulated debt, but the time to act is now. Ireland can spend some money this year, but needs to go back to a budget deficit below 3% within 2 years. And the money spend this year must create sustainable growth.&lt;/div&gt;</description>
