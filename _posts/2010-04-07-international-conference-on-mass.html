As with other industries the solution/approach must take a more hollistic view to also cater for a wider variety of legal (certification) and manufacturing (small batches, short leadtime) requirements ("managed customization").</i></div><div><i><br /></i></div><div><i>The proposed paper will suggest a software-based approach and will discuss the experience with respect to the relevance of templates and platforms for the given solution.</i></div><div><br /></div><hr /><div>... was accepted.
