The Open Core Licensing <a href="http://blogs.the451group.com/opensource/2008/09/10/managing-expectations-with-open-core-licensing/">discussion</a> is really refreshing! Lots of good ideas and lots of good energy. Obviously the "earlier" versions of the model were more oriented towards a "bait-and-switch" approach (get a good stack for free, but then if you want to do real/serious enterprise computing, you have to to buy the real thing :)). Right now the models have evolved into more mature "suggest-and-complement" models (aka. Open Core Licensing). And I am using the word "mature", because talking about it (the desire the make money with open source) like this, should be the norm and not the exception.<div><br /></div><div>Yes, I am working for Progress (the <a href="http://www.progress.com/index.ssp">software company</a>, not the <a href="http://ecprogressview.electrolux.se/international_english/node15.asp">vacuum cleaners</a> :)) and we have an Open Core Licensing Strategy (looking into the "Open Source is not a Business Model" <a href="http://blogs.the451group.com/opensource/2008/10/13/open-source-is-not-a-business-model/">report</a> it is debatable, if Progress (formerly known as IONA) may also fall into the open-closed category) and I am proud of it.

</div><div><br /></div><div>The important part for me is freedom (of choice for customers) and value (for customers). We are <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">suggesting</span> to use our integration-core, -platform, -stack (whatever you want to call it) to do JAVA-based integration and if you are happy with it, we are happy too. We then offer consulting, training and support for it (by the way, our distribution is called <a href="http://fusesource.com/">FUSE</a>), but the choice is always yours. It is complete and has a value on its own. There are no "hidden features", that will cripple the distribution to create an "artificial" up-sell opportunity.</div><div><br /></div><div>There you have it. Great value for money.</div><div><br /></div><div>But wait there is more: We already have or will integrate this core with lots of interesting add-ons, which will <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">complement</span> the core and will make the resulting platform even more valuable (e.g. Mainframe integration, C++ integration, .Net integration, data integration, ...). And yes, we are looking for ways to get our fair share of the generated end-customer value. But that should be a win-win. The secret is in the add-ons. They must bring a significant, additional, unique value to the table, that would otherwise be hard to get (e.g. implementing it yourself :)). If the add-ons are structured like this, everybody will be happy to pay money for it/them (given you need them :)).</div><div><br /></div><div>And there you have it again. Even more value for money.</div><div><br /></div><div>But the biggest value of all is for me that with this model customers stay in control. It is a pay-as-you-go model, means nobody is forced to spend large sums of money upfront to get something done. And this creates good, value-oriented, customer-vendor relationships. </div><div><br /></div><div>I like it. </div>
