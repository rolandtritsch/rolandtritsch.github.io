title: Ooohhh boy ... twitterfeed is no more
---
The other day I got and email that [twitterfeed is no more](http://twitterfeed.com) (they recommend to use [buffer](http://buffer.com) or [dlvr.it](https://dlvr.it) instead).

My social media setup was to post to Google+ and then use twitterfeed to cross-post to [twitter](https://twitter.com/innolocity) and [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/roland.tritsch).

With twitterfeed going out of business I am ...

* ... going to retire my Google+ account
* ... going to use [HootSuite]() to selectively post to twitter (business, technical, work) and facebook (private, personal)
* ... going to continue to use [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/rolandtritsch/) to publish pictures
* ... going to continue to use [GitHub](http://www.tritsch.org) to host my blog (and will cross-post on [medium](https://medium.com/@rolandtritsch) and [linked-in](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rolandtritsch) for visibility).

If you follow me on Google+, please feel free to do so on twitter :).
