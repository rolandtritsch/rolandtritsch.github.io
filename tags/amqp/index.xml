      <description>Updated (2022-01-01): Added stage.
At Community we are building a platform that will allow you to have meaningful conversations with large audiences &amp;hellip; at scale!!!
The architectural backbone is a shared-nothing micro-services architecture, that uses an event-bus for state propagation.
To avoid any kind of 2-phase-commit shenanigans we are publishing events at-least-once (not exactly-once). That means our services need to be able to and are able to deal with dublicated events gracefully (by ignoring them).</description>

      <description>(I start to like this &#34;plane blogging&#34; thing :))AdrianÂ blogged about Microsoft embracing AMQP.
Just from a technical point of view this is good news (assuming it will help the adoption of the Advanced Message Queueing Protocol (AMQP)), because AMQP is a very cool (and extremely well thought through) standard.
Given that there might be a renewed interest in the standard, let me just try to explain (again) what it is good for: The main benefit of AMQP (besides a couple of very cool features in the standard itself) is that it will (finally and for the first time) allow messaging stacks to interoperate.</description>
