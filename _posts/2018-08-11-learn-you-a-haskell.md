title: Learn you a ... Haskell!
---
In the last 6 month I have started to wonder.

First of all ... I am convinced that using the concepts of functional programming will give you better results (more maintainable/changeable/extendable code). Not embracing functional programming will (sooner or later) put you (and the organisation you are leading) at a competitive disadvantage (compared to those who do).

In that context I have put some time into learning more [Scala](https://github.com/rolandtritsch/scala-aoc-2017) (the learning never stops :)) and have also looked at [Kotlin](https://github.com/rolandtritsch/kotlin-aoc-2017).

But most importantly I worked my way through [THE Haskell Book](http://haskellbook.com) and through [Category Theory for Programmers](http://www.tritsch.org/2018/04/03/category-theory.html) by [Bartosz Milewski](https://bartoszmilewski.com/about).

I like Haskell. A lot. I like it even more now after I discovered [eta](https://github.com/rolandtritsch/eta-hello-world) (Haskell on the JVM).

In that context I was looking for more resources to learn Haskell and stumbled over ["Learn you a Haskell"](http://learnyouahaskell.com). Great book with good [excersises](https://github.com/rolandtritsch/haskell-learn). Highly recommended.
