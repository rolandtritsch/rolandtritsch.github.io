(Blogging from the plane again. This time on my way to the Progress <br />Sales Kickoff in Miami.)<p>The other day I stumbled over a <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/itemis/axis2-vs-cxf-high-noon-apache-presentation/">good presentation</a><br />from <a href="http://www.falkoriemenschneider.de/index.html">Falko Riemenschneider</a>. The high-level summary is ...</p><p>* Axis 2 is not as easy to use as CXF, but is more ubiquitous in the <br />marketplace (and got better documentation, including a book in german)<br />* CXF is a very well developed piece of software, but needs more <br />people using it (and needs more/better documentation, including a book <br />in any language, but preferably in english)</p><p>I need to think about this book thing. Anybody interested to write a <br />book about CXF in English?</p><p>&lt;Couldn't keep my mouth shut&gt;<br />I am volunteering myself to translate it into German.<br />&lt;/Couldn't keep my mouth shut&gt;</p>
