                    <p>Career Development is one of these touchy-feely topics that are hard to talk and think about. Especially for when you are young. There are probably a couple of reasons for this (in no particular order) &hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>I do not need a Career Development Plan, because I am very good at what I do and the next step/opportunity will present itself soon anyway.</li>
<li>Yep. I want you to develop me and my career. When can we meet?</li>
<li>This is pointless. So far I had 10 Career Development Plans and none have worked. I never really get and/or find the time to really work on my career.</li>
<li>&hellip; and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>In computer science and software engineering this is compounded by the fact that you are sorounded by opportunities and temptations. In our field career development means to know where you are going and saying <strong>No</strong> to a lot of offers (or so-called opportunities). Otherwise (after a while) you will realize that you have done a lot, but did not go anywhere (Yogi Berra: If you don&rsquo;t know where you&rsquo;re going, you might not get there.).</p>
<p>Here at Nitro we have something that I have never seen before: We have a Coach. And our Coach is a real Coach. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-bragg-75492010">Braggy</a> is an Aussie ex-national-basketball-league coach with a 30 year business career and now he helps us (and me) to go through all the changes and transitions we need go through to take Nitro to the next level. He works with all of us (from the C-level down to every individual contributor) and tries to make all of us bring our best game to the court. Always. Consistently. Every day.</p>
<p>Some of the discussions that I had with him have shaped and sharpened my thinking on how to get the most out of a group of people and how to make everybody perform at their best. As always it starts with the Power of Why and the engagement and the transparency that comes with it (I will also talk about this and what we do in that regard in an upcoming blog post). Complementary to the ability to align people behind your reason for existance, who also want to invest in your ability to develop people.</p>
<p>My first believe is that people development happens on different time lines. Yes, you want and need quarterly personal (skills) development goals and on top of that you probably want/need a yearly skills development plan (building on your strength and/or eliminating some of your weaknesses). But on top of this, I think you also want/need a Career Development Plan or even better Life Action Plan. A plan that answers questions like &hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Here is what I want to do with my live! House or Appartment? Owning or renting? Children? When and how many? Staying in one place or moving around?</li>
<li>Here is what I am doing to get there!</li>
<li>Here is the help/support that I need to get there!</li>
</ul>
<p>The first insight/realisation here is that <strong>YOUR</strong> career is owned by <strong>YOU</strong> (Note: Owning your career is one of pillars of the Sofware Craftmanship movement). Nobody is going to do your career development for you or to you.</p>
<p>When you are younger you can and probably only want to think/talk about the next 2-3 years. When you get older you can probably see what you want to get out of your life (and your career) in the next 5-10 years. I have developed a template that I am using to facilitate career development discussions (in case somebody comes to me and says: Hey Roland, I am struggling to see where I am going with my life and with my career, but think/feel that it would be good to develop a sharper picture of where I am going. Do you have a framework or an idea, how I can go about it?). Happy to <a href="mailto:roland@tritsch.org?subject=Career%20Development%20Plan%20Template">share</a> it, but in any case I think that it is important to point out that career is only on component of your life. You probably also want to think and talk about Lifestyle, Health, Family, &hellip;</p>
<p>Now &hellip; let&rsquo;s talk about the career piece.</p>
<p>And as we all know, in the worst case (especially in software development organisations) it is a very one dimensional discussion about becoming a team-lead and then a manager and then &hellip;</p>
<p>In the worst case people who are very good individual contributors feel forced to pursue a “people management” career, because they cannot see any other way to progress their career and the perception is that the only way to have a career is to become a people manager.</p>
<p>In general career development is associated with some kind of advancement (promotion) in a corporate structure. That advancement can come with &hellip;
,</p>
<ul>
<li>more people reporting to an individual</li>
<li>more responsibility (and more freedom to decide something)</li>
<li>more money</li>
<li>bigger sales targets</li>
<li>“bigger” title (whatever that means)</li>
</ul>
<p>The next better thing is to make sure that you have a <strong>split pyramid</strong> (with equal pay and equal power and equal influence). This split pyramid implements an individual contributor career path (to become a CTO) and a people manager career path (to become a VP Engineering).</p>
<p><img src="/images/dual.png" alt="Dual Career Path"></p>
<p>But even then there is a risk that you are creating not very productive discussions. Means all discussions are still about rising to the next <strong>level</strong> and about how to get promoted. Means the discussions are not about what suits you as a talented human being, as a character, as a personality and what you want to do with your live. Means even if there is a career path for individual contributors you can come to the conclusion that the only way to have a career is to rise through the ranks and go from one level to the next. Looking at career development in such a limited way can create a lot of frustration. For the individuals (who cannot see any options for them besides getting a promotion) and for the people managers (who cannot promote everybody all the time).</p>
<p>I was always looking for a way to turn this conversation on the head: Make the discussion about <strong>how to build personal value</strong>. If this happens, the career becomes a result of building that value.</p>
<p>To make these disussions more <strong>open</strong> we (in Nitro) will try to add a third dimension to the career development discussion, where we will try to allow people to have a technical or a non-techncial career, but on top of it they can decide, if they want to <strong>rise</strong> (through the ranks), <strong>stretch</strong> (themselves) or <strong>master</strong> (a craft).</p>
<p><img src="/images/rsm.png" alt="Rise, Stretch, Master"></p>
<p>Now imagine that you have two separate career path established and available (just imagine :)) and you overlay both career path with the concepts of Rise, Stretch and Master.</p>
<p>Means now individuals can choose to develop their careers as people manager or as an individual contributor and can decide if they want to rise or stretch themselves or become a master.</p>
<p>Let’s explain that more.</p>
<p>But before we do that let’s agree on a couple of fundamentals &hellip;</p>
<p>As already stated above, good career development starts with the individual. It starts with finding out &hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>&hellip; what your talent is (are you a natural born killer)</li>
<li>&hellip; what you care about. What your passion is.</li>
<li>&hellip; what you (really) want to do.</li>
</ul>
<p>Career development is not skills development. Planning a career is much more strategic in nature. The skills development plan is more tactical and short-term in nature and needs to complement the career development plan. You iterate on your skills development plan every 3-6 month, but you iterate on your career development plan only every 12-24 month.</p>
<p>Leadership is not a career choice. To have a career you need to be a leader. You need to lead yourself. And as you expand your sphere of influence you need to lead others (regardless if you are people manager or an individual contributor) &hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>To be(come) a leader you need to develop your believes and values</li>
<li>To be(come) a leader you need to move from “people work with me, because of what I do” to “people work with me, because of who I am”</li>
</ul>
<p>A career development plan also needs to be informed by your living circumstances and does not need to be focused on one company (the one that you are with right now) only. A career development plan is also a live development plan.</p>
<p>A career development plan can be structured along the lines of &hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase the sphere of influence (self, team, org, company, industry)</li>
<li>Develop expertise (acquire a skill)</li>
<li>Make an experience (get a chance to do something difficult)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let’s come back to Rise, Stretch and Master.</p>
<p><strong>Rise</strong> is about developing and increasing your sphere of influence.</p>
<p><strong>Stretch</strong> is about expanding you skills and experience and become a multi-purpose tool.</p>
<p><strong>Master</strong> is about getting good at one thing (an inch wide, but 1000 feet deep). Sooner or later you will be a/the recognized industry expert on that thing.</p>
<p>You can Rise, Stretch and Master as a People Manager and as an Individual Contributor. You can also try to Rise, Stretch or Master for a while (a couple of years) and then decide to switch to something else, because you have evolved. But, I would not suggest or expect that you switch every year. I am a stretcher. And I have been doing this for the last 15 years (I started as a master). If you see yourself flip-floping around, you might want to take a look at it and reevaluate why you do what you do.</p>
