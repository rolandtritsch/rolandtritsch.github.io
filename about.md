![Roland on the recumbent](../images/recumbent.jpg)

My name is Roland Tritsch. I am a Software Engineer. I am a Manager. I am a Husband and a Father. I work for [Nitro](https://www.gonitro.com/about) in Ireland and I am responsible to build and run the infrastructure platform for the next-generation SaaS solutions. I like computer science. I believe that computers and software can help to make this place a better place. When I am not building, running or fixing things, I am on my recumbent.
