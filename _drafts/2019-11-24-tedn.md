In the last 25 years I have build and run multiple distributed software engineering organisations.

My management style/philosophy is based on a couple of core believes ...

* [The Power of Why](http://www.tritsch.org/reveal-the-power/why.html) - I like to lead with **Why** (to make sure [Talent and Passion can meet a Purpose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TAqSBMZDY8))
* People first - I always think and feel that people are the solution (not the problem)
* Heterogenerity for the win - You have to be different to complement each other (and [to create innovation](http://www.tritsch.org/2017/06/12/productive.html))
* No surprises - Everybody (at all times) should be clear on what is happening and why it is happening, which leads to ...
* **Building and maintain trust (and respect) (between the people) at all cost!!!***

At the end it is simple. To be successful you need to ...

* hire great people
* need to have sense of direction (where to go and why it matters to get there)
* excute well (how to get there)

From that I have deducted a couple of principles how an engineering organisation should look like/should do/be good at ...

* [Building the right thing vs. building it right]()
* [Building faster horses vs. building cars]()
* [Building skateboards and bicycles and ...](http://www.tritsch.org/2018/05/26/skateboard.html)

Over the last 5 years I have also started to think about one other dimension of engineering management that needs to be considered in the next 10 years: [Hub-First vs. Remote-First vs. Pod-First](http://www.tritsch.org/2019/03/01/pod-first.html).

When we look at [the development of the workforce](https://online.csp.edu/generation-z-in-the-workforce) in the next 10 years (Gen X, Y and Z) and when we look at the pressure we see when it comes to attracting and retaining talent and when we look at [the increasing urbanisation](https://workplaceinsight.net/urbanisation-is-taking-place-inside-our-offices-as-well-as-in-the-outside-world) (which makes it more and more difficult to get people into an office location), I am convinced that [remote-first]() is an organisational model that will become more prevelant (especially for engineering organisations up to 200 engineers) ([and I am not alone](https://buffer.com/state-of-remote-work-2019)).

Building and running a remote-first engineering organisation needs solutions for good/suitable ...

* Behaviors
* Processes
* Tools
* Technologies

... and [a lot of awareness for the problems and challenges that come with the model](https://runningremote.com/challenges-of-working-remotely).

I have already seen/experienced a couple of good implementations of the remote-first model (and a couple of bad ones) and have decided that I really want to figure this out. And (as always) there is no better way to figure it out than to do it, means I am going to be(come) [The Extreme Digital Nomad (TEDN)](https://www.instagram.com/theextremedigitalnomad) and will do some `#ExtremeDigitalNomading` and will share my experience with good/suitable behaviors, processes, tools and technologies (by means of blog posts and [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/theextremedigitalnomad)/twitter posts).

Hope you are joining me on the adventure (and will also help me to figure it out :)).
