title: How to make your options in the future suck less!!!
---
If you are here for some advise on how to invest your money (using options), you are in the wrong place.

This is about how to use Scala Options in Scala Futures!!!

Erik Bakker delivered an excellent [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGMndafDcc8) on this topic in 2015 at the ScalaDays in Amsterdam.

On Sunday morning I was on Dad-duty driving Alexandros to a paint-ball battle and ended up in coffee shop with three hours of zone time. I decided to spend it on implementing [some code](https://github.com/rolandtritsch/scala-unsuck) so that I/we can play around with it.

Enjoy :).
