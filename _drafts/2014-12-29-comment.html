Triggered by some consulting that I did last year I started to think about the potential for innovation in Big Data. There are obviously lots of definitions available what Big Data is or means.<br /><br />One of the most popular ways to talk about Big Data is to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data" target="_blank">talk about the 3 Vs</a>: Volume, Variety and Velocity. At Fujitsu we talk about 4 Vs, because we add Value as the 4th V, because we believe Big Data is meaningless unless you turn the data into information and then into knowledge and (actionable) insight.<br /><br />For me it just means that you bring the 4 "W"s together and do good with it.<br /><br />The 4 "W"s are Who is doing What, When and Where.<br /><br />And there are two-distinct areas for innovation: At the edges, improving the quality of the data that we want to merge and in the hub, improve the merging of the data.<br /><br />Let me talk about two innovative ideas that can make a difference here.<br /><br />Improving on the edge mainly means to improve one or the 4 "W"s. At the first you might think that the &nbsp;When does not leave a lot of room for improvement or innovation, but you could then start to think about timelines that will also include future events and I feel that there is still lots of room for innovation. You might also feel that the Who is kind of solved<br /><br />As discussed in an earlier blog post, I think we are heading towards what I call the Sensoric Revolution.
