title: Rise, Stretch, Master - Career Development ... the Nitro Way
---
When you do what I do, then sooner or later you might think that you have seen it all.

Here at Nitro we have something that I have never seen before: we have a company coach (Chief Performance Officer or Chief Productivity Officer or Chief Reduce-Friction Officer or ...).

[Braggy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-bragg-75492010) is an aussie-ex-national-basketball-league coach with a 30 year business career and now he helps us (and me) to go through all the changes and transitions we need go through to take Nitro to the next level.

A couple of month ago I had an interesting discussion with Braggy about how good career development looks like.

And as we all know, in the worst case (especially in software development organisations) it is a very one dimensional discision about becoming a team-lead and then a manager and then ...

Means the perception is that the only way to have a career is to become a people manager.

The next better thing is to make sure that you have a **split pyramid** (with equal pay and equal power and equal influence). This split pyramid implements an individual contributor career path (to become a CTO) and a people manager career path (to become a VP Engineering).

But even then you are limiting yourself. Means all discussions are still about rising to the next *level* and about how to get promoted. Means the discussions are not about what suits you as a talented human being, as a character, as a personality and what you want to do with your live.

And we all know all kinds off models for technical and non-technical career development, but they still feel **limted**. Means they create this wierd up-or-out discussions, where peopele feel that the only way to have a career is to rise/get promoted to the next *level* (whatever that means).

To make these disussions more *open* we (in Nitro) will try to add a third dimension to the career development discussion, where we will try to allow people to have a technical or a non-techncial career, but on top of it they can decide, if they want to **rise** (through the ranks), **stretch** (themselves) or **master** (a craft).

Career development is on anybody’s mind. Either you think about your own career or the career of the people that work with you or for you.

But most of the time we think about it in a very limited way.

In the worst case having a career gets narrowed down to being promoted to have people reporting to you and being promoted to have more people report to you.

Let's discuss a better way to talk about career development.

## First things first

Let’s first define and agree what the problem is.

Let’s first think about how we normally and usually feel about career development ...

* In general career development is associated with some kind of advancement (promotion) in a corporate structure. That advancement can come with …
  *(more) people reporting to an individual
  * more money
  * more responsibility (and more freedom to decide something)
  * bigger sales targets
  * “bigger” title (whatever that means)
* In the worst case people who are very good individual contributors feel forced to pursue a “people management” career, because they cannot see any other way to progress their career
* And even if there is a career path for individual contributors you can come to the conclusion that the only way to have a career is to rise through the ranks and go from one level to the next
* Looking at career development in such a limited way can create a lot of frustration. For the individuals (who cannot see any options for them besides getting a promotion) and for the people managers (who cannot promote everybody all the time)

## The better way

Now imagine that you have two separate career path established and available (just imagine :)) and you overlay both career path with the concepts of Rise, Stretch and Master.

Means now individuals can choose to develop their careers as people manager or as an individual contributor and can decide if they want to rise or stretch themselves or become a master.

Let’s explain that more.

But before we do that let’s agree on a couple of fundamentals ...

* Good career development starts with the individual. It starts with finding out …
  * ... what your talent is (are you a natural born killer)
  * ... what you care about. What your passion is.
  * ... what you (really) want to do.
* Career development is not skills development. Planning a career is much more strategic in nature. The skills development plan is more tactical and short-term in nature and needs to complement the career development plan. You iterate on your skills development plan every 3-6 month, but you iterate on your career development plan only every 12-24 month
* Leadership is not a career choice. To have a career you need to be a leader. You need to lead yourself. And as you expand your sphere of influence you need to lead others (regardless if you are people manager or an individual contributor)
  * To be(come) a leader you need to develop your believes and values
  * To be(come) a leader you need to move from “people work with me, because of what I do” to “people work with me, because of who I am”
* A career development plan also needs to be informed by your living circumstances and does not need to be focused on one company (the one that you are with right now) only. A career development plan is also a live development plan.
* A career development plan can be structured along the lines of ...
  * Increase the sphere of influence (self, team, org, company, industry)
  * Develop expertise (acquire a skill)
  * Make an experience (get a chance to do something difficult)

Now let’s come back to Rise, Stretch and Master.

And like it is with all career development you probably do not want ask yourself what you want to become or what you think society or your environment expects from you, but rather what/who do you admire and what do you enjoy doing. Picking a career or a career path based on what you think others think of you and/or expect you to do (or be) is a recipe for disaster.

### Rise

This is about developing and increasing your sphere of influence.

How does Rise for a People Manager look like ...

* Managing larger groups of people and become a manager of managers.

How does Rise for an Individual Contributor look like ...

* First you are giving talks at meetups, then at smaller and larger conferences and at the end you are recognized as an industry expert in your field and you are invited to deliver key-note speeches
Stretch
* This is about expanding your skills and experience.
* Your aim to is to learn, understand and become effective in new fields.
* It will be easier and more effective if your stretch is based on your current knowledge.
* (Small steps) Otherwise it is a whole new direction which is something else completely.

How does Stretch for a People Manager look like ...

* Moving from managing 20 engineers to managing 5 solution engineers

How does Stretch for an Individual Contributor look like ...

* An engineer moves from engineering into product management

### Master

* This is about becoming an expert, a master of a specific domain.
* You absolutely have to love the area of expertise you choose...if not you will never be a master.
* To become a master takes time, but masters don't care, they love their area of expertise.

How does Master for a People Manager look like ...

* You know that you are good at running a small team of Software Architects (up to max. 5 people) and this is what you do

How does Master for an Individual Contributor look like ...

* You like programming languages and sooner or later will write a book about it

## Principles of Rise, Stretch, Master

* You get to choose.
* You don't have to choose just one. You can actually work on two or all three at once.
* Make your choice on your love of the work not on image, status or even financial reward.
