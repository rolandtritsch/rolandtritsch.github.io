<p>Over the last 2 years I did a fair bit of Haskell (after doing a fairer bit of Scala for 8 years).</p>
<p>And I love Haskell.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong: If you are tied to the JVM eco-system (and who is not these days), my opinion is that Scala is your best option to do functional programming in the JVM.</p>
<p>At the same time writting code in Haskell feels very natural to me. And sometimes it is not the big features/capabilities that make a difference. For instance in my case (in Haskell) I like &hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&hellip; the <strong>where-clause</strong>. There are obviously two way how you can compose/decompose a problem. Either you start with the pieces and then compose a/the solution from it or you start with what you want/need and decompose it into smaller and smaller pieces until you are done. The second approach feels more natural to me. Haskell supports both (with let-in and the where-clause), but most of my code starts with a function that is a single line and a where that explains how that line can be evaluated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&hellip; the ability to have <strong>primes</strong>. As I said it is the simple stuff. One small thing that I love about Haskell is to be able to name variables as/with <code>name</code> and <code>name'</code> and <code>name''</code> and &hellip; (not too much so; I normally stop at 2 primes), because it allows me to stay in the flow and do not think (too much about naming variables; not saying that finding good anmes for variables is not important :)).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&hellip; the <strong>go</strong> convention. I love recursions (and folds :)). The convention to have a function that pattern matches on the &ldquo;start-the-recursion&rdquo;, &ldquo;do-the-recursion&rdquo; and &ldquo;stop-the-recursion&rdquo; (using a function in the where-clause that is called go) breaks down the problem into three very manageable sub-problems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As I said &hellip; these <em>features</em> (if you want to call them that) are not big, but sometimes the small things make a difference.</p>
