      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to have a Nissan Leaf (for 6 years) and now I have a Renault&#xA;Zoe (for 2 years).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was and I am very happy with these cars. I am very happy to drive&#xA;electric cars. Point. Period.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I like is to learn what it takes to drive an electric car. You&#xA;need to learn a lot. About the car. About electricity. About&#xA;batteries. About the (charging) infrastructure. And lot&amp;rsquo;s more &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This blog post is interesting in more than one way, because &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I am going to discuss a topic that is deer to my heart: What do we&#xA;need to do to get to a better place with respect to a sustainable&#xA;energy future?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And I am going to use a new approach: Where I am first going to&#xA;articulate my thoughts and then I am going to complement it with a&#xA;fireside chat that I had with &lt;code&gt;chatGPT&lt;/code&gt; about the topics at hand.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here we go &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;6 years ago I wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;https://tedn.life/2016/02/08/why-are-we-surprised-hot-hot-hot/&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; to express that my&#xA;wife loves me for a lot of different reasons and that there is no&#xA;reason to be surprised about the climate change that we are&#xA;experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;http://tedn.life/images/2023-01-14-surprise-II/micro.jpg&#34; style=&#34;display:block; margin:auto&#34; width=&#34;80%&#34; hspace=&#34;1%&#34; vspace=&#34;1%&#34;/&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note: If you do not know, why there is a picture of a microwave here,&#xA;you need to read the &lt;a href=&#34;https://tedn.life/2016/02/08/why-are-we-surprised-hot-hot-hot/&#34;&gt;first blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am compelled to write about it again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mainly because it did not get better. It got worse. And I do not mean&#xA;the climate change. That was to be expected (at least by some of us).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am driving an electric car. It is a great experience. Not to a small part, because the Irish government is trying very hard to make it a good experience. Government grants, good infrastructure, friendly people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other day, I &lt;em&gt;noticed&lt;/em&gt; something that leaves room for improvement. On a Sunday afternoon, I was charging my car at the quick charger at the LUAS station in Stillorgan. The parking lot is operated by NCPS and has signs on the ground and on sign-posts to indicate that the spaces are reserved for electric vehicle (EV) charging. So &amp;hellip; I started charging my car (expected charging time 45 mins) and went to the restroom for a bathroom break and came back &amp;hellip; to find my car clamped!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Christina loves me. For a lot of reasons. One of them is that I have this habit of putting stuff into the microwave, heat it for 10 mins (I am exhaturating) and then try to take it out with my bare hands, while shouting (with this expression of total surprise on my face) &amp;ldquo;hot, hot, hot&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why am I surprised? If you put stuff into the microwave (longer than 30 secs) it is probably going to be (very) hot, right?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Range anxiety? What range anxiety! (My first road trip with the BADMobile :))</title>

      <description>In case you are wondering ... this is the BADMobile ... (ask me, if you want :)) ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OZ-7MZE99kc/VVwg4HIJQEI/AAAAAAAAFKI/ZWYSpZyyumU/s1600/17063309921_3bcc3ba3c8_z.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OZ-7MZE99kc/VVwg4HIJQEI/AAAAAAAAFKI/ZWYSpZyyumU/s320/17063309921_3bcc3ba3c8_z.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/rolandtritsch/3691359722&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;My friend Klaus&lt;/a&gt; and myself have spend more time and more miles (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/rolandtritsch/3691360566&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;on motorbike(s)&lt;/a&gt;) together than we care to count. And the pattern is that once in a while we need to do something crazy. This time around we decided that in the next 5 years we will visit all of the major road races in the UK &amp;amp; Ireland (at least) once. To refresh your memory, these are ...&#xA;&#xA;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.manxgrandprix.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Manx GP&lt;/a&gt; on the Isle of Man&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.northwest200.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Northwest 200&lt;/a&gt; in Portwest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://ulstergrandprix.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ulster GP&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;on the Dundrod Circuit&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.southern100.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Southern 100&lt;/a&gt; on the Isle of Man (in the south)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.motorcycling-ireland.com/calendar/Proposed%20Road%20Race%20Short%20Circuit%20Dates%202015%20rev%207.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a couple more&lt;/a&gt;, but let&#39;s start with these four&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;Last week we went to see the Northwest 200. The trip was awesome!!! Road racing is different. One good way to learn more about it, is to watch &#34;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/film-review-road-1.1829969&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Road&lt;/a&gt;&#34;. The movie tells the story of the Dunlop Dynasty (a family of road racers). Robert Dunlop died on 15. May 2008 racing at the Northwest 200. Two days later his son Michael was racing again and won the 250cc race at the Northwest 200. While we were there we obviously took the chance to pay our respects to Robert and his even more famous brother Joey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wUH2xkApGy0/VVyEzuBVZjI/AAAAAAAAFKc/tesjCOvdWF0/s1600/2015-05-15%2B10.46.04.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wUH2xkApGy0/VVyEzuBVZjI/AAAAAAAAFKc/tesjCOvdWF0/s320/2015-05-15%2B10.46.04.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;So ... it was an emotional trip, but also very inspiring and very impressive. The skill, the passion, the commitment is unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;YOUTUBE-iframe-video&#34; data-thumbnail-src=&#34;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E-Gi2A7rEW4/0.jpg&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;266&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/E-Gi2A7rEW4?feature=player_embedded&#34; width=&#34;320&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But ... that is not what I wanted to talk about!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What I wanted to talk about is range anxiety, because I now own the Nissan Leaf for 2 month and this was the first time I wanted to go on a road trip. Naturally I was concerned about the range of the car and if I will be able to make it from Dublin to Portrush or if I will get stranded somewhere in the middle of nowhere with no power and no charge point nearby.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;To cut a long story short: All my fears were unfounded, but there are a couple of things that I learned and that you need to think about when you do a road trip with an electric car. Here are my lessons learned ...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-H1HeLnJMO_8/VVy-dz0GAxI/AAAAAAAAFKs/QuAUAEhe6KM/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-05-20%2Bat%2B17.59.29.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;320&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-H1HeLnJMO_8/VVy-dz0GAxI/AAAAAAAAFKs/QuAUAEhe6KM/s320/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-05-20%2Bat%2B17.59.29.png&#34; width=&#34;285&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;First things first: Let&#39;s talk about range and the range of the car. The advertised range is 199km. That is not realistic. A more realistic range under optimal conditions is 150km. Charging the car to 100% takes a long time, means on a road trip you will probably use the quick chargers that you find on the way and charge to 80% (30-45 mins). With 80% charge you can get a range of 120km. But again that is not realistic, because to feel comfortable you probably want to have 20km of range left over by the time you get to the next charging point (just to make sure you have enough left over in case you get lost looking for the charging point or in case the charge point is broken and you need to go to the next one). That means that for a road trip you should calculate with a range of 100km between charge points. Wind resistance increases with velocity, means it makes a big difference if you are driving 80km/h, 100km/h or 120km/h, means to get to 100km range you cannot go faster than 100km/h, means you will roughly drive for an hour and then charge for&amp;nbsp;45 mins and that leads me to &lt;b&gt;the big conclusion of the road trip&lt;/b&gt;: Getting there (to Portrush) was actually no problem. There are plenty of charge points on the way and if you realize that you need to get into this rhythm of 60 mins of driving followed by 45 mins of charging you can go as far as you want, but ... it is going to take you twice as long as you think to get there, means for me a road trip has nothing to do with range (anxiety), but with making peace with the fact that it is going to take twice as long to get to where you want to go. In our case it took us 5 hours to get to Portrush. In Portrush I was talking to another Nissan Leaf owner and he mentioned that earlier in May he went from Portrush to Cork and it took him 14 hours. I have to say that I actually enjoyed this rhythm of 60 mins of driving and then a cup of tea and a quick walk. We arrived safe and sound and were very relaxed (not exhausted).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The second take-away from the trip is that the infrastructure in the Republic of Ireland (ROI) and in Northern Ireland (NI) is second to none. There are plenty of charge points in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ecarni.com/charge-point-map&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;NI&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.esb.ie/electric-cars/electric-car-charging/electric-car-charge-point-map.jsp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ROI&lt;/a&gt;. All of them work. All of them are free of charge (using the ESB charge card). All of them are compatible with the Leaf. Very rarely you arrive and need to wait for somebody else to finish charging (and if so most of the time it is less than 15 mins). There are mobile apps (for iPhone and Android) to help you to find the charge points and the navigation system in the Leaf will help you to find the best charging points on the way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At home I am fine with the public charging points and with my home charging points, means I do not miss the granny cable, but while traveling (especially when you arrive at the B&amp;amp;B at the other side) I would not mind to have the extra option of a granny cable. The original Nissan cable is &amp;lt;believe-it-or-not&amp;gt;EUR 1000&amp;lt;/believe-it-or-not&amp;gt;. No comment :(. But I am thinking to get &lt;a href=&#34;https://evconnectors.com/portable-ev-charger/Portable-Mode-2-16a-J1772-EVSE-13A-Domestic-Plug-With-Sensor&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The best thing about charging the car while being on the road is that you get to talk to a lot of other Leaf drivers/owners and all kinds of people who want to know how this works :).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OJVzEWhAo4Q/VV13ebSkFTI/AAAAAAAAFLM/kzYcACnzm5M/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-05-20%2Bat%2B18.22.58.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;320&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OJVzEWhAo4Q/VV13ebSkFTI/AAAAAAAAFLM/kzYcACnzm5M/s320/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-05-20%2Bat%2B18.22.58.png&#34; width=&#34;271&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Bottom line: Great trip. Great car. Great experience. Don&#39;t rush it. Take your time. Enjoy it. I am looking forward to the next road trip (visiting the Ulster GP :)).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;A year ago I had a couple of pints with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linkedin.com/pub/dan-salt/5/409/835&#34;&gt;Dan Sal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linkedin.com/pub/dan-salt/5/409/835&#34;&gt;t&lt;/a&gt; (Chief Software Architect at GE Energy) and we discussed the current state of affairs with respect to IT and Software Architectures/Solutions in the Energy/Utility sector. As a result I started to develop an interest in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGiy7Safnhg&#34;&gt;Smart Meter&lt;/a&gt; (just watch the first 5 min), &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ylcpyqz4fk&amp;amp;feature=related&#34;&gt;Smart Grid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XuCJBvq6Sk&#34;&gt;Micro Grid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1L5HjtxJQY&#34;&gt;Grid 2.0&lt;/a&gt; concepts/solutions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Here is a summary of the problems as I see them ...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;we need to become more intelligent about how to consume energy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;we need to become more intelligent about how to produce energy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;and we need to become more intelligent about how to distribute/store energy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;The main focus of this blog entry is on the first bullet point, but I also quickly want to talk about the second and third bullet. Becoming more intelligent about producing, distributing and storing energy and that means first of all &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/27/business/27grid.html?_r=2&amp;amp;oref=slogin&#34;&gt;becoming more intelligent about producing, distributing and storing renewable energy (wind, water, solar, ...)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XuCJBvq6Sk&#34;&gt;Micro Grids&lt;/a&gt; might be an interesting approach to consider in this area, but this means that the IT infrastructure must be able to deal with lots small independent energy &#34;providers&#34; (maybe even down to the household level). There are ideas how to implement something like this, but nothing ready for prime time yet. Storing energy to deal with the peaks is another dimension of the problem that needs to be consider, but a combination of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity&#34;&gt;old&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/electric-vehicles-could-surpass-grid-or-support-it/&#34;&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; (e.g. V2G - Vehicle to Grid) approaches might be suitable to provide some relief here.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Let&#39;s come back to the main topic: How to become more intelligent about consuming (less) energy (in the first place).&#xA;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Three years ago I was driving in a cab from Zuerich Airport to a customer meeting. The cab was a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.toyota.com/prius-hybrid/&#34;&gt;Toyota Prius&lt;/a&gt;. It was my first time in a Prius. In general I work in a cab (email, phone, SMS, whatever, ...), but this time I was totally fascinated by a/the display in the middle of the dashboard. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/its_our_city/2838668732/&#34;&gt;The display&lt;/a&gt; showed how the Prius was producing and consuming energy with its fuel-/electro- engines and -dynamos (in (soft-/near-) real-time). Brilliant!!! You get into a traffic jam and the natural play-/compete-with-your-car instinct kicks in and you try to move the car through the traffic jam, just by using the electro-engine (just by being gentle on the accelerator).  And even without a traffic jam you are tempted to constantly compete with the car to make optimal usage of the available energy. The question is not anymore how fast you get from A to B. The question becomes &#34;can I get from A to B using less than a gallon (less than 4 liters) of fuel&#34;. The display creates a totally new sense of awareness about what is going on and with that it starts to change behavior. The guys behind the Prius are geniuses. Adding the display makes the difference between a good and a great car, because with the display the Prius is not only a good car it is also changing societies, by changing awareness levels and behaviors.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What can we learn from this? Easy ... it is not good enough to optimize the way you consume energy, you also need to provide direct feedback to the consumer on how he/she is doing and must give the consumer tools/ways to influence the amount of energy that gets consumed. Basically you need to empower the consumer!!! You need to share the responsibility between those who produce the energy (to produce energy with the lowest environmental impact possible at the lowest possible cost) and those who consume the energy (to consume as less as possible).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The bad news is that in general right now households/consumers of energy (gas, oil, electricity, ...) are not aware of what, when, how (much) they consume. They get a bill (every month or every quarter) and have no insight into why they consumed this amount of energy and what to do/change to maybe reduce the energy consumption. The (immediate) feedback is missing. The &lt;i&gt;display&lt;/i&gt; is missing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But there is also good news. We can fix this. Originally Smart Meters concepts and technologies got introduced to allow the utility companies to read your meter without sending somebody to your house (a clear benefit for them; not so much for you :)). In the meantime smart meters have evolved. They can and will fix the &#34;remote reading&#34; problem, but they also allow you (the consumer) to get immediate feedback on your energy consumption.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But it might be a couple of years until smart meters get installed in (all of) the households (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_meter&#34;&gt;the only country in Europe, which is almost done with this is Italy&lt;/a&gt;). What do you do in the meantime? One option is to use a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.electricity-monitor.com/energy-monitor-comparison-chart-i-26.html&#34;&gt;wireless energy monitor&lt;/a&gt;. The good news is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bluelineinnovations.com/flash/corporatevideo/video_large_medium.html&#34;&gt;these devices are available, do not cost a lot and are easy to install&lt;/a&gt;. The bad news is they are very limited with respect to their capabilities and connectivity.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What I am looking for is a smart meter or an energy monitor that is connected to my (W)LAN and is able to dump/collect the data to a hard-disk of my choice (laptop or special purpose appliance). I then want to be able to display the data in real-time on a display of my choice (TV, computer screen, mobile phone, ...).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;To my knowledge such a device/appliance does not exist today.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now things get even more tricky. How can I find out if my energy consumption is good or good enough (read near the optimum)? And how can I analyze/break down my energy consumption to identify potential culprits?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;At the end we could upload the (location-aware) data to a data-warehouse and run analytics on it that would allow us to calculate the average per person per household in a certain area and provide feedback to the best/worst five energy consumers in the area. If you consume much more energy than you neighbors (per person) you might want to find out what the hell is going on (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.org/powermeter&#34;&gt;Google is working on something like this&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bottom line: To change the behavior we need to visualize the problem (i.e. how much energy (electricity, gas, oil, ... you consume). It will take 5-10 years to bring smart meters to the majority of households in the developed world. In the meantime energy monitors can/should be used to give immediate feedback to you (the consumer), but currently these devices are very limited in terms of what they can monitor (most of them can only monitor electricity), capability (storing historic data) and connectivity (make the data available to a/the community for analysis).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hhhhhhmmmmm ... any ideas??? Otherwise it seems I need to get my soldering gun out. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
