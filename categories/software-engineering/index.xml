      <description>Over the last 2 years I did a fair bit of Haskell (after doing a fairer bit of Scala for 8 years).
And I love Haskell.
Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong: If you are tied to the JVM eco-system (and who is not these days), my opinion is that Scala is your best option to do functional programming on the JVM.
At the same time writting code in Haskell feels very natural to me.</description>

And then you need to keep engagement high and attrition low and you need to build/deliver something (with good/high velocity/efficiency/quality).
One key component to get this right is a good/the right structure for your engineering organisation.</description>
