      <description>First of all: May the 4th be with you! Always!!!&#xA;Second: (Obviously) In May Microsoft is going to retire Skype and is asking everybody to migrate to Microsoft Teams.&#xA;My only use-case for Skype was to dial landline numbers from my (ubuntu) laptop. As an alternative I have looked into Google Voice, but was not able to associate my Irish mobile phone number with my Goggle account to enable the voice features.</description>

      <description>I am calling it! I declare my Advent of Code (AOC) for 2024 done! Finally!&#xA;Clarification: This does not mean that I did all of it, but I did what I wanted to do and was able to do to make the tree look like this &amp;hellip;&#xA;The last star that was missing was part1 of Day21 (more on this later).&#xA;This year my main focus was on refreshing my scala3 skills and to learn a lot about how AI-enabled IDEs can support a scala-engineer to write better code and to solve problems faster.</description>

      <description>It is this time of the year again: We are all doing the Advent of Code (AOC), right?&#xA;For me the AOC has never been about speed and solving the problems fast and the leaderboard.&#xA;For me it has always been about learning something new or getting better at something (sharpening the saw) or developing a new, better way to solve problems (also known as becoming a better sofware craftsman).</description>

      <title>Huffman Trees/Codes - Why are they different?</title>

      <description>Right now I am solving the 99-scala-problems. Again!!!&#xA;This time around I am using them to learn more about what it means to be an Augmented Software Engineer (ASE). Just subscribe to the podcast to follow along.&#xA;P50 is to build a Huffman tree and to return the set of Huffman codes for the given string.&#xA;codeium found a good implementation, but struggled to find tests that worked.&#xA;I then tried various websites ([1], [2], [3], [4]) to test various strings and noticed that the trees and the resulting set of codes are different between the implementations.</description>

      <title>Augmented Blogging - The Art of Prompting</title>

      <description>This is a landmark blog post. I just introduced a tag called Augmented-by-AI. And this post is tagged with it.&#xA;This is going to be the new normal. Let me explain &amp;hellip;&#xA;First things first: This blog post is not written by chatGPT.&#xA;It is Sunday morning, 6am and I am sitting here in my living room in my PJ with a cup of coffee and I am typing this. Believe me &amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>This blog post is interesting in more than one way, because &amp;hellip;&#xA;I am going to discuss a topic that is deer to my heart: What do we need to do to get to a better place with respect to a sustainable energy future? And I am going to use a new approach: Where I am first going to articulate my thoughts and then I am going to complement it with a fireside chat that I had with chatGPT about the topics at hand.</description>
