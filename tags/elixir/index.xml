      <description>Updated (2022-01-01): Added stage.
At Community we are building a platform that will allow you to have meaningful conversations with large audiences &amp;hellip; at scale!!!
The architectural backbone is a shared-nothing micro-services architecture, that uses an event-bus for state propagation.
To avoid any kind of 2-phase-commit shenanigans we are publishing events at-least-once (not exactly-once). That means our services need to be able to and are able to deal with dublicated events gracefully (by ignoring them).</description>

      <description>Here comes part III of the Hamler blog post series &amp;hellip;
One of the observations was that for/on Day21 hamler ~6000 times slower than haskell, where in general we where able to see that it was 5-20 times slower.
Just looked into this a little bit and there is good news and bad news. The good news is I found something.
I can make the hamer solution run 10 times faster by changing the implementation of part1 from &amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Here comes part II of the Hamler blog post series &amp;hellip;
For this year&amp;rsquo;s Advent-of-Code I wanted to take a look at Hamler.
I just finished implementing all of the part-1 solutions in Hamler.
I had to skip Day 20 (the seamonster), because Hamler only supports a very small/limited number of packages, which means I would have needed to write a lot of code before I would have been able to tackle the actual problem.</description>

      <description>Hamler Blog Post Series &amp;hellip;
 Hamler (I) - First week (this post) Hamler (II) - All solutions for part 1 (in Hamler and Haskell) Hamler (III) - Making Day21 10 times faster   What&amp;rsquo;s at the intersection of Haskell, the Erlang Beam/OTP and the Advent-of-Code?
Yes, right: Hamler!
Hamler is a Haskell-like language that runs on the Erlang Beam/OTP.
At Community we are big Beam/OTP fans (because we like highly-scalable and highly-available shared nothing micro-services systems).</description>

      <description>Last week I was in London attending Code Elixir LDN 2019 delivering a lightening talk on 3 languages in 3 minutes &amp;hellip;
 This was my first Elixir conference. We had about 100 people there. The conference was very well organized. From what I can see London is one the Elixir hotspots in Europe.
All of the talks where good, but a couple of them where of even better value to me personally (because I am the newbie) &amp;hellip;</description>
