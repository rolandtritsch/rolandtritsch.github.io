title: Security vs. privacy ... the big confussion!
---
A friend of mine builds/runs a startup. The startup is building a HW device that can replace your router at home and will allow you to regain control of your privacy.

When the discussion starts Hermann needs to answer a lot of questions abut firewalls and excryption and all kinds of security related questions. It takes a while for people to realize that privacy has nothing to do with security.

You can share your privacy securely!!!
