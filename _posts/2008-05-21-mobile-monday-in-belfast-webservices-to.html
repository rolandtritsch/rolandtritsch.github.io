title: Mobile Monday in Belfast - WebServices to foster innovation
---

Monday evening I spent in <a href="http://mobilemondaybelfast.org/">Belfast</a> at the <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.net/">Mobile Monday</a>, presenting on <a href="http://mobilemondaybelfast.org/files/folders/may_2008/entry48.aspx">"How to access WebServices from the iPhone"</a> (pictures are available upon <a href="http://mobilemondaybelfast.org/photos/may_2008_mobile_web_services/slideshowpro.aspx">request</a> :)).<div><br /></div><div>Good event. We had 30 people in the room. Good format. Four short presentations with good networking before and after the talks.

</div><div><br /></div><div>My favorite presentation was <a href="mailto:michael.crossey@aepona.com">Michael Crossey</a> from <a href="http://www.aepona.com">Aepona</a>, talking about <a href="http://mobilemondaybelfast.org/files/folders/may_2008/entry50.aspx">"Exploiting Telco Asserts through Telecom WebServices"</a>. </div><div><br /></div><div>One interesting point that he raised is that Mobile Telecom Operators are currently challenged (or even threatend) by "Over the top" applications (applications that use the network as a bit-pipe), which will over time marginalize the value of the operators in the value chain.</div><div><br /></div><div>Therefore the operators have to find new innovative ways to stay relevant. And they also know, that time is of essence. And they know, that if you are in a business for a while, you develop a certain amount of a tunnel-vision. Therefore they need help. The suggested approach is to expose network capabilities as WebServices (maybe comparable to the Amazon Elastic Computing Cloud - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=201590011">EC2</a>) and let other people innovate based on this set of capabilities.</div><div><br /></div><div>WebServices as a way to make asserts digestible for a large group of people to foster innovation. Here is a new business value for WebServices.</div><div><br /></div>
