title: FUSEforge Lightsaber/Lightsabre - Research on Asynchronous Distributed OSGi (for Jedi's :))
---

The <a href="http://cxf.apache.org/distributed-osgi.html">Distributed OSGi spec (RFC 119)</a> is coming along nicely, means now might be a good time to raise the head and start to think about what might come next. A couple of month ago <a href="http://coderthoughts.blogspot.com/">David</a>, <a href="http://romanroe.blogspot.com">Roman</a> and <a href="http://www.tritsch.org/">myself</a> got together and concluded to set up a research project on the alternatives available to potentially extend the Distributed OSGi spec with some asynchronous messaging concepts/capabilities.<div><br /></div><div>The research is still ongoing, but the intermediate results (including a first demo!!!) are now available on <a href="http://fusesource.com/forge/">FUSEforge</a> (Project <a href="http://fusesource.com/forge/projects/LIGHTSABRE">Lightsabre</a>). </div><div><br /></div><div>The demo will also be presented at <a href="http://www.osgi.org/DevConEurope2009/HomePage">OSGi DevCon Europe</a>. Maybe (another) reason to attend. Enjoy and stay tuned.</div>
