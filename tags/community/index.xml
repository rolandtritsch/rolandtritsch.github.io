      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s at the intersection of Haskell, the Erlang Beam/OTP and the Advent-of-Code?
Yes, right: Hamler!
Hamler is a Haskell-like language that runs on the Erlang Beam/OTP.
At Community we are big Beam/OTP fans (because we like highly-scalable and highly-available shared nothing micro-services systems). Our entire backend runs on the Beam (written in Elixir).
And I am a big fan of Haskell and Functional Programming and the Advent-of-Code (I guess you can see, where this is going :)).</description>

      <description>I am in Hidden Valley Holiday Park. Working on the career progression framework for Community. It is 5am and &amp;hellip; I realized something. Don&amp;rsquo;t hold your breath: It is something obvious (but I thought I share it anyway).
If you want to be successful as an Extreme Digital Nomad, having a good internet connection is absolutely essential (this is more true now then ever before, because of Covid-19 an even bigger part of the job relies on videoconverencing).</description>
