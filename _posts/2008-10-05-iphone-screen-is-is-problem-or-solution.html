Lot's of interesting exciting stuff is going to happen with FUSE over the next couple of month.Â <div><br /></div><div>Especially on the tooling side. The other day I was riding in the car with <a href="http://oisinh.wordpress.com/">Oisin Hurley</a> (Head of Tool Development for FUSE) and we discussed the value of having NOT a lot of screen real-estate, because it really makes you think about what the problem is the user wants/needs to solve and how you can guide the user through that process.<div><br /></div><div>There is a good video-cast available from Apple, which talks about<a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/index.action"> the principles of good UI design for the iPhone</a>. I believe these principles are good principles regardless how much screen real-estate you have. To that extend designing UIs for limited screen real-estate is more a solution than a problem. It creates the right attitude :).</div><div><br /></div><div>Other opinions? Thoughts?</div></div>
