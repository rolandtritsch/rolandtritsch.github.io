title: Productive Friction and Diversity ... the pillars of innovation ... or: How not to build faster horses!
---
In the week of Jul., 10th we are going to do our next Hackweek.

The concept is not new. A lot of companies do it.

![Dilbert on Hackweek]()

The question is: Why is it valuable?

For me the answer is: Because you want to make sure you are not building faster horses!

[Henry Ford once famously said](): If I would have build what customers want, we would have build faster horses.

Means ... one of the responsibilities of an engineering/technology organisation in a product company is to complement the view on what the customer wants with a view on what is possible (always and only listening to the customer can create a huge blind-spot).

![Yin-Yang]()

For that view to develop you need enviroments that allow people to think out of the box (or even enchourage that kind of thinking). These environments need to be creative (creating a lot of mutations). And they need to have a strong filter (kill ideas early and fast; a strong selection function). You need **productive friction**. And if you get everything right then you create a high probablity that one of your crazy ideas will be validated by the market as being truly innovative.

And that is the reason why we are doing Hackweeks. We want to create headspace that will allow us to build cars (or in our case smarter documents).

But that is not all of it. After you have the environment you need to fill it with enough ideas. With enough heterogenous ideas. With enough ideas that a different. For that to happen you need people that are different. Being different needs to become the new normal. This is where diversity comes in. Homogenous teams will never be as productive and as innovative as heterogenous teams. And obviously one very important aspect of diversity (especially in software engineering organisations) is gender diversity, but there is more: cultural/geographical diversity (US/EMEA/APAC), education (degree in english, degree in computer science), ...

Being innovative is a challenge. But is can happen. Let's make it happen :).
