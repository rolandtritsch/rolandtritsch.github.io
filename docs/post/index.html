      I love Haskell
    </a>
  </h2>
  
    Over the last 2 years I did a fair bit of Haskell (after doing a fairer bit of Scala for 8 years).
And I love Haskell.
Don&rsquo;t get me wrong: If you are tied to the JVM eco-system (and who is not these days), my opinion is that Scala is your best option to do functional programming in the JVM.
At the same time writting code in Haskell feels very natural to me.

Finding good and the right talent for an engineering organisation is as challenging as ever.
And then you need to keep engagement high and attrition low and you need to build/deliver something (with good/high velocity/efficiency/quality).
One key component to get this right is a good/the right structure for your engineering organisation.
And you probably want to structure it in a way so that it not only works today, but also in 2-3 years from now, because otherwise by the time you are done building the org it will not work (anymore)).

      Advent of Code ... Final cut (... and First cut :))
    </a>
  </h2>
  
    Today Advent of Code 2018 started again (at 05:00am (GMT))!!!
And &hellip;
&hellip; just in time &hellip;
&hellip; today I am also wrapping up Advent of Code 2017!!!
My first implementation was (obviously) in Scala.
And that one alone was interesting, because I also used ScalaCheck for property-based testing and ScalaMeter to implement performance tests for all solutions.
I then made the Scala code cross-compile with ScalaNative.
At the time I was also learning Kotlin and spend some cycles to port the code to Kotlin.

    Last year I spend some time and money to &ldquo;renovate&rdquo; my old 17-inch Macbook Pro (remember the good old times &hellip; when Apple was building good laptops with great keyboards and no touchbar :)).
For the last 6 month I was running VirtualBox on it hosting an Ubuntu image.
That kind of worked (a little bit slow at times and managing the ports was (sometimes) challenging, but otherwise &hellip; ok).

    Not sure if this has ever happen to you, &hellip;
&hellip; but once a month I am sitting in a hotel lobby or a coffee shop and I cannot (for the life of it) make Chrome show me the login screen to the Wifi portal and then you start to fiddle around with stop/start the Wifi and/or disconnect/connect to the Wifi and/or start a different browser (e.g. Firefox or Safari) and/or try a private browser window and/or clear the DNS cache and/or &hellip; reboot!

      Learn you a ... Haskell!
    </a>
  </h2>
  
    In the last 6 month I have started to wonder.
First of all &hellip; I am convinced that using the concepts of functional programming will give you better results (more maintainable/changeable/extendable code). Not embracing functional programming will (sooner or later) put you (and the organisation you are leading) at a competitive disadvantage (compared to those who do).
In that context I have put some time into learning more Scala (the learning never stops :)) and have also looked at Kotlin.

      Kotlin ... the better Java?
    </a>
  </h2>
  
    Everybody is talking about Kotlin. Me too!!!
Obviously the question is: Is Kotlin the next better thing?
Is Kotlin going to replace Java? Is Kotlin going to replace Scala? Is Kotlin the next better language that will make Software Engineers (much) more productive?
To find out I ported my Scala Advent of Code solutions to Kotlin.
My main take aways are &hellip;
 if you know Java, learning Kotlin will be easier and faster than learning Scala Kotlin is without a doubt &ldquo;the better Java&rdquo;  it compiles fast it runs fast it has very good tooling/IDE support (namely (obviously) the support in Intellij is first-class) it runs on Android hell &hellip; it even runs on Raspberry Pi with Arrows it has a very nice (pure) functional programming library   if you know Scala, learning Kotlin will be even easier, but you will also feel that you are not gaining anything or even that you are loosing some capabilities that are valuable  Sooooo &hellip; my exec summary is &hellip;

      Advent of Code 2017 ... Revolutions!!!
    </a>
  </h2>
  
    Let&rsquo;s talk about the Advent of Code &hellip; again!!!
Last time we talked about a/the Scala implementation.
This time around I figured that I need to understand what the hype about Kotlin is all about and decided to port my Scala solutions to Kotlin.
There is a separate blog post on what I think about Kotlin, but overall it was a positive experience. I like Kotlin (but would not suggest/recommend it as a replacement for Scala).

      The cost of building a skateboard ... and a lot of PSs
    </a>
  </h2>
  
    The other day I was explaining again how to build an MVP and I was using the skateboard picture (again :)).
In the middle of the discussion I realized that we only had half of the discussion, because we only talked about the direct benefits of the approach: Fast feedback, less risk to build the wrong thing, &hellip;
We did not really talk about the cost of getting these benefits. The meeting got interesting when I started to point out that this is not about building the solution the fastest way or the cheapest way.

  </h2>
  
    OK &hellip; it took me a while, but &hellip; hopefully it was worth it!!!
Last year at christmas I did the Advent of Code and &hellip; really liked it!!!
If you do not know it, it is a series (25 of them) of code puzzles that need to be solved to unlock a/the christmas tree (every day (between Dec. 1st and Dec. 25th) a new/the next puzzle becomes available).
The puzzles do a lot of different things and will test your ability to come up with good/clever datastructures/algorithms.

      Tenable new hire training ... and integrating sbt-release with sbt-github-release
    </a>
  </h2>
  
    The other day I was flying to the Tenable new hire training in Columbia/MD and that means &hellip; 8 hours of uninterrupted coding time!!!
At the same time, I saw/found the sbt-guthub-release plugin and started to wonder, if it would be possible to combine it with the sbt-release plugin.
And while I was thinking about this I figured &ldquo;what the hell&rdquo;, why not creating another opinionated giter8 template to bootstrap my scala projects, means at the end I decided to spend the 8 hours on bringing a couple of things together &hellip;

      Category Theory for Programmers ... Reviewing THE course!

  </h2>
  
    A couple of weeks ago Angel pointed me to a very nice lecture: Category Theory for Programmers (from/by Bartosz Milewski).
Bartosz Milewski is a physisist, a philosopher (on computer science and life in general :)) and runs his own company to make the world a better place by means of Category Theory and Haskell :).
The course is long &hellip;

      Assembling a Gatling (gun) ... how hard can it be?
    </a>
  </h2>
  
    Back to the roots!!!
I am writing Gatling tests (again :)). (Obviously) I used to do this (a lot :)), when I was with Gilt (for an obvious reason :)).
To get going again, I had to make the basics work &hellip; again.
The basics are: Make the sbt-gatling plugin work to build (end-to-end integration) tests/simulations and then create a &ldquo;deployable&rdquo; (fat) jar (using sbt-assembly).
This proved to be more difficult than I thought (because this used to work).

    Nitro&rsquo;s mission statement is &hellip;
And right now &hellip; Digital Transformation is a very hot topic. For most of the Fortune 500 companies! And it is also a very complex topic (e.g. How to make sure that (PDF) documents can become a first class citizen in the Digital Transformation initiative).
Companies obviously want it. Either to gain a competitive advantage or at least to not put themselves at a competitive disadvantage.

    MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) are massive!!!
I did my first one 7 years ago (on Cousera; Martin Odersky&rsquo;s course on Functional Programming with Scala).
Since then there has been an explosion of sites and offerings. By now it is clear that, if you do not know, how to use these sites to your own advantage you are putting yourself at a competitive disadvantage (from a skills development point of view).

    A lot has been written and said about what you need to do as a manager or more specifically as a manager of a software development team/group/organisation.
You need to understand people and the business and technology (software engineering processes and practices, tools and frameworks, programming languages, &hellip;).
You need to be a manager and a leader. You need to be a friend and a dad (or mother) and a boss.

    As already discussed: I am obsessed with building cars!!!
Not in the sense that I want/need to build cars, but in the sense that Henry Ford famously once upon a time (apparently not) said, that if he would have build what customers wanted, he would have build faster horses.
Luckily he was able to complement the input from the customers (we want faster horses) with a view of what is possible (cars).

      Productive Friction and Diversity ... the pillars of innovation ... or: How to NOT build faster horses!

  </h2>
  
    In the week of Jul., 10th we are going to do our next Hackweek.
The concept is not new. A lot of companies do it.
The question is: Why is it valuable?
For me the answer is: Because you want to make sure you are not building faster horses!
Henry Ford once famously said (or not said :)): &ldquo;If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.

      Leadership at Amazon ... Productive Friction 2.0
    </a>
  </h2>
  
    The other day I was reading the letter that Jeff Bezo&rsquo;s is writing to shareholders every year.
The obsession with fast, good decision making was and is resonating with me.
I like fast decision making processes that produce good decisions. And I like cultures and behaviors that foster environments that produce these fast, good decisions.
In the case of Amazon they have developed a set of leadership principles and behaviors (like the famous 2 pizza rule) to protect their agility and velocity, while they are scaling (and to make sure they stay a Day 1 company).

    I am reading it again: Clean Code.
This time I am reading it differently. The first time around (6 years ago), I was reading it and learned a lot (about how to write clean code) and was using it (a lot) to get other people on board and convince them that this is the way (the only way) to write code.
I still think that the book can serve that purpose.

The other day I was wondering again: What is Operational Excellence and why should you have it?
For me Operational Excellence is the ability of an organization to make (initially small and then over time bigger and bigger) promises and keep them consistently and reliably within budget (time and money).

    I am driving an electric car. It is a great experience. Not to a small part, because the Irish government is trying very hard to make it a good experience. Government grants, good infrastructure, friendly people.
The other day, I noticed something that leaves room for improvement. On a Sunday afternoon, I was charging my car at the quick charger at the LUAS station in Stillorgan. The parking lot is operated by NCPS and has signs on the ground and on sign-posts to indicate that the spaces are reserved for electric vehicle (EV) charging.

      Can Micro-Services Systems be simple?
    </a>
  </h2>
  
    Architecting and designing large (distributed) systems makes you think about complexity. A lot!!!
The first question that you want to ask yourself is probably &ldquo;What is complexity?&quot;.
For that I recommend to watch Rich Hickey&rsquo;s talk on complexity (Simple Made Easy). In this talk he raises awareness for the difference between something being complex or complicated. And he also (rightfully) points out that simple is actually very hard (every idiot can build a complicated solution) and that simple is a relative term (something that is simple for you can look complex and/or complicated to others).

    Finding a good and maybe even the right org structure for an engineering organization is something of a dark art.
Initially everything is so easy. 5-10 engineers are in one location, have one boss, work on the one thing and have one common skill.
But then you are successful. And you hire more engineers and then you realize that to derisk the hiring and the growth you probably want to hire in more than one location and then a couple of engineers will leave, because the people management aspect of the being an engineering manager is not something that comes naturally to most of us.

In general software architecture is something that you cannot see or touch, but in October I had the engineering managers in Dublin and that chance was just too good to not use it, means we all hoped on a bus and went to see the real thing!

Nitro (like a lot of other startups) is going through growing pains. In the last 2 years we have hired a lot of people (and have not been able to retain all of them). We have build a lot of systems, platforms, features and products (and some of it turned into technical debt faster than we wanted). We implemented processes and practices (and not all of them made us more productive or faster).

One of them is that I have this habit of putting stuff into the microwave, heat it for 10 mins (I am exhaturating) and then try to take it out with my bare hands, while shouting (with this expression of total surprise on my face) &ldquo;hot, hot, hot&rdquo;.
Why am I surprised? If you put stuff into the microwave (longer than 30 secs) it is probably going to be (very) hot, right?

Not so much, because I needed a better IDE (Emacs rules :)), but because I got interested in the claim that you can use Xamarin to do Android and iOS cross-platform development with #F.

Picking something from your list of urgent things to do is kind of easy, but how can you make sure you are not missing the opportunity/chance to work on something important, if you get the chance to do so?

      Effective Android - Using Apache CXF to access SOAP services
    </a>
  </h2>
  
    A year ago I developed a small set of demos to show how toaccess SOAP services from the iPhone. To do this I used a very interesting feature of Apache CXF: The ability to generate a complete JavaScript client-side SOAP-stack on the fly.

I just finished an update/upgrade of this demo to show that it also works with the Android Phone. I also ported it to maven, means installing, building and running the demo is much easier now.

Oisin Hurley is starting to get a bit irritated with people that unselectively duplicate their twitter stream to their Facebook status. They're different interactions, people.
This is an interesting observation and creates a bigger question: where do we go with this social-networking, micro-blogging, status-update thingy? 
Initially it was easy: there was just/only twitter and this was the place to do micro-blogging and status-updates, but by now all social-networking sites (Facebook, Linked-In, XING, Plaxo, Bebo, .

    Is Open Source Innovation an oxymoron? Is Open-source fostering innovation or killing it?
There are two school of thoughts out there: First, there are lots of people, who say that open-source is not fostering innovation or even killing it, because it is just about the reimplementation of already solved problems and that it actually kills innovation, because it keeps people from implementing solutions that can not be protected from being reimplemented as an open-source solution.

    The term "software crisis" was coined 1968 by F.L. Bauer during the first NATO Software Engineering Conference in Garmisch, Germany and was used by Dijkstra in his very famous lecture on "The humble programmer":
[The major cause of the software crisis is] that the machines have become several orders of magnitude more powerful! To put it quite bluntly: as long as there were no machines, programming was no problem at all; when we had a few weak computers, programming became a mild problem, and now we have gigantic computers, programming has become an equally gigantic problem.

    Micro-blogging (Twitter, Pounce, Facebook, ...) just go a little bit easier. Check out GTwit. It is a light-weight Google App, that allows you to access your Twitter account from any browser you might have access to. It is based on the Twitter API. It stores all tweets that you send/receive in a private "Google-Cloud" and allows you to search on them by whatever you like (word, person, tag).

      The iPhone - and what you can learn from thinking about it

  </h2>
  
    On Sunday I went to the driving range and while Alexandros was working on my early retirement plan (aka. he making lots of money with golf and I am managing his career), I was reading an article on Businessweek about the new iPhone 3G contracts. The article made me think again. It made me think about two presentations that I saw recently: One by Michael Crossey from Aepona at the Mobile Monday in Belfast and the other one by Peter Moeckel from T-Labs (the R&amp;D think-tank of Deutsche Telekom) at the OSGi community event in Berlin.

    in the last 4 weeks, i was talking to sailesh panchal (Enterprise Architect - Payments at Lloyds TSB) and hermann sauer (EDS - Integration Engineering Lead EMEA North/Central) about the future of mobile payment.
there is clearly a need and a benefit to find a solution, but implementations are not available yet (leaving aside lots of POCs that are out there). one obvious driver is the need to find a replacement for cheque payments.

overall it went well. i did an erase and install (as a 20 year windows user i feel much more comfortable with clean installs. maybe next time if will try it the mac-way :)) and also used the exercise to clean up my disk and the way i work. the biggest problem was that leopard does not come with iLife, means you need to find your old tiger CDs and reinstall iLife from there (or buy (!

It is called Software Engineering Radio and talks about trends and technologies in Software Engineering (OSGi, Rest, Opensource, ...). I was told that one of the next issues will be an interview with Peter Kriens on the current state of affairs with respect to OSGi.

    Two weeks ago I attended the OSGi Community Event in Berlin.
One of the presentations was from Deutsche Bahn about their new Mobile Integration Platform (MIP). It was not only in this presentation that I felt that OSGi has become the ICE of deployment platforms. A 300 km/h high-speed trend/train with a lot of momentum. Think about it: Do you want to be on the train or in front of it.

    Yesterday I went out and had a pint with Sailesh Panchal. He is an Enterprise Architect with the payments division of Lloyds TSB in London. Part of his responsibility is to foster innovation in Lloyds. 
Obviously innovation needs to be directed towards a measurable goal/target/impact for the customer and/or the company. To judge, if an/the idea was just a good idea or a real innovation, you must be able to show some measurable ROI in a defined timeframe.

    The embedded/mobile software market is growing faster than the rest of the industry. From my point of view this just the tip of the iceberg, because we are at the beginning of the sensoric revolution. 
Historically all data got created in the "middle" and we used integration technologies to distribute the data. Web 1.0 turned out to become the preferred mechanism to get this done and we changed the content/data in the middle through the web (e.

    Monday evening I spent in Belfast at the Mobile Monday, presenting on "How to access WebServices from the iPhone" (pictures are available upon request :)).
Good event. We had 30 people in the room. Good format. Four short presentations with good networking before and after the talks. 
My favorite presentation was Michael Crossey from Aepona, talking about "Exploiting Telco Asserts through Telecom WebServices". 
One interesting point that he raised is that Mobile Telecom Operators are currently challenged (or even threatend) by "

    Just finished a/the review of agreat presentation on security and security concepts published by Ciaran McHale on www.ciaranmchale.com.
His claim is that 80% of the the perceived complexity of any given subject is not in the concept, but in the way it is explained to people. His quest is to fix this. Therefore he has started to publish a series of very well written presentations to introduce technical concepts in the most simple way possible.

I like innovation and I like to innovate. Sometimes this requires to take a leap of faith to produce a quantum leap.

    Now. Lets get things started. Lets talk about innovation. 
for a well-known reason (at least) once a year i am in greece. this year we also went to rhodos to see the colossus. 
question is: was this innovation? i mean, is it innovative to come up with the idea to build something like the colossus?
what is the nature of innovation? how is it for instance different from creativity?
