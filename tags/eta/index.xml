      <description>Today Advent of Code 2018 started again (at 05:00am (GMT))!!!
And &amp;hellip;
&amp;hellip; just in time &amp;hellip;
&amp;hellip; today I am also wrapping up Advent of Code 2017!!!
My first implementation was (obviously) in Scala.
And that one alone was interesting, because I also used ScalaCheck for property-based testing and ScalaMeter to implement performance tests for all solutions.
I then made the Scala code cross-compile with ScalaNative.
At the time I was also learning Kotlin and spend some cycles to port the code to Kotlin.</description>
