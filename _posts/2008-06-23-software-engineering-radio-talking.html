In the last four weeks a lot of people asked me about this "show" I am listening to on my way to work. It is called <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/">Software Engineering Radio</a> and talks about trends and technologies in Software Engineering (<a href="http://www.se-radio.net/podcast/2007-12/episode-80-osgi-peter-kriens-and-bj-hargrave">OSGi</a>, <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/podcast/2008-05/episode-98-stefan-tilkov-rest">Rest</a>, <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/podcast/2008-04/episode-94-open-source-business-models-dirk-riehle">Opensource</a>, ...). I was told that one of the next issues will be an interview with Peter Kriens on the current state of affairs with respect to OSGi.<div><br /></div><div>Check it out.Â </div>
