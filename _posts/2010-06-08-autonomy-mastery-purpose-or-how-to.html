This is going to be a short blog post. A Facebook post by <a href="http://www.facebook.com/brikelly">Brian Kelly</a> made me revisit the stuff that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_H._Pink">Dan Pink</a> did and is doing.<div><br /></div><div>The main idea behind Drive (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc&amp;feature=player_embedded">RSA</a>, <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html">TED</a>) is that Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose unleash the creative power of individuals and teams, not material/monetary incentives. Opensource and Wikipedia and ... are obviously the classic/legendary examples for this FACT (and yes, it is a fact :)).</div><div><br /></div><div>Check it out. It is an Idea Worth Spreading :).</div>
