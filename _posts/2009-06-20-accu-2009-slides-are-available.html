title: ACCU 2009 - Slides are available
---

A couple of weeks ago I attended <a href="http://accu.org/index.php/conferences">ACCU 2009</a> to deliver a talk on "<a href="http://accu.org/index.php/conferences/accu_conference_2009/accu2009_sessions#RESTful%20Services%20and%20Distributed%20OSGi%20-%20Friends%20or%20Foes">RESTful Services and Distributed OSGi - Friends or Foes</a>" and "<a href="http://accu.org/index.php/conferences/accu_conference_2009/accu2009_sessions#AJAX%20for%20Mobile%20Devices%20-%20Using%20Apache%20Projects%20to%20get%20the%20job%20done">AJAX for Mobile Devices - Using Apache Projects to get the job done</a>". The conference was very well organized (thanks Giovanni) and took place in the beautiful city of Oxford. The format (keynote presentations and smaller breakout sessions) allowed for a good mix of thought-provoking presentations and good discussions. The audience was made up from very-experienced software-engineers and no-BS project-mangers.<div><br /></div><div>My most favorite presentation/keynote was delivered by <a href="http://accu.org/index.php/conferences/accu_conference_2009/accu2009_sessions#The%20Benefits%20of%20Abstraction%20in%20Patterns">Linda Rising (The Benefits of Abstraction in Patterns)</a>. She talked about the potential of patterns going beyond the ability to put structure into the domain of software engineering.</div><div><br /></div><div>I am looking forward to learn about the agenda for next year.</div>
