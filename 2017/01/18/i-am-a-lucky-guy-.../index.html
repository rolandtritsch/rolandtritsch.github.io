<p>Good morning everybody. On behalf of Nitro: Welcome to <a href="http://2016.data.bythebay.io">Data by the Bay</a>.</p>
<p>My name is Roland Tritsch and I am German and I am the VP Engineering at Nitro. And I am a lucky guy.</p>
<p>I am a lucky guy, because in a lot of cases in my career I have been at the right time in the right place.</p>
<p>25 years ago I was with Electronic Data Systems and build one of the first client-server bill-of-material systems based on a relational database. The customer was GM and the database was build by a company called Relational Technologies Inc here in Alameda. If you know the name of the database come and see me afterwards and I will give you one of these unique and incredibly cool Nitro USB sticks. It is a real collectors item. And it is a bottle opener too!</p>
<p>15 years ago I was with IONA technologies and build large-scale, distributed SOA systems using CORBA, SOAP and REST, when nobody really knew what SOA was.</p>
<p>5 years ago I was with the Gilt Group building and deploying one of the first large-scale micro-services implementations in the industry with more than 300 micro-services.</p>
<p>And right now, I am with Nitro and we are at the fore-front of figuring out how to use data engineering and machine learning and natural language processing to turn data and documents into value for our customers. And that means I am lucky again, because &hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip; you can think and talk about this anyway you like, but people used to say &ldquo;Software is going to eat the world&rdquo;. Today I am probably not the only one to say that &ldquo;Data and more specifically access to good data and the ability to turn that data into actionable insights for the company and the customers is going to eat the world&rdquo;.</p>
<p>2 weeks ago Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google said &ldquo;Mobile first is yesterday, AI first is tomorrow&rdquo; and 2 month ago DeepMinds AlphaGo did beat one of the best three Go players in the world 4:1. This was not suppose to happen for another 10 years. You do not have to be a genius to see that we are at the beginning of something big.</p>
<p>In all cases I was lucky enough to be surrounded by extremely talented and passionated software engineers who maybe did not have all of the answers, but were determined to figure it out.</p>
<p>And today I am here. I am here with all of you. I am a lucky guy. I think we are all lucky to be here. This is the right time and the right place to figure this data/ML/AI thing out.</p>
<p>In Ireland I would say that I am pretty sure that the next 5 days will not be bad. Not bad at all.</p>
<p>If I translate that into american english then I can say that I am convinced that the next 5 days are going to be awesome.</p>
<p>Please feel free to find me later today to talk about what you do with your data. And do not forget to tell me what database RTI actually implemented.</p>
<p>Thanks for being here and welcome again. Enjoy the conference.</p>
